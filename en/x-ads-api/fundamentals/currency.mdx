The type of a currency is identified using [ISO-4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217). This is a three-letter string like `USD` or `EUR`. The value of a currency is represented in micros. For USD, $5.50 is encoded as 5.50*1e6, or 5,500,000. To represent a “whole value”, you need to multiply the local micro by 1e6 (1\_000\_000) for all currencies.

Most currencies have a “precision” of two (like USD: $1.23).

* `AED`, `VEF`, `PKR`, `IDR`, `HKD`, `QAR`, `PHP`, `NZD`, `INR`, `EUR`, `ARS`, `THB`, `MXN`, `EGP`, `DZD`, `SAR`, `LBP`, `COP`, `TRY`, `SGD`, `MAD`, `AUD`, `USD`, `MYR`, `CAD`, `BRL`, `GBP`.

The following currencies don’t use a decimal:
