title: Pagination
---

In order to support a larger maximum number of campaigns and efficient retrieval of all entities associated with an account, the Advertiser API now supports pagination on many GET endpoints. The paging mechanism is easy to use and very similar to the REST APIâ€™s cursor-based pagination as described in [Using cursors to navigate collections](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/pagination).

## Getting Started

For designated GET requests, we now accept `cursor` and `count` query parameters, which are both optional. If a response has more than `count` entities, these endpoints will now return the first `count` entities and a `next_cursor` key in the response JSON.

`GET https://ads-api.x.com/5/accounts/abc1/campaigns?count=50`

```json
{
  "data": \[...\],
  "next_cursor": "c-3yvu1pzhd3i7",
  "request": {...}
}
```

To get the next series of responses, you would add `cursor` to your query params:

`GET https://ads-api.x.com/5/accounts/abc1/campaigns?cursor=c-3yvu1pzhd3i7&count=50`

```json
{
  "data": \[...\],
  "next_cursor": "c-3w3zdyg8ywan",
  "request": {...}
}
```
## Going Deeper

For most endpoints, the maximum `count` value is **1,000**, the minimum is **1**, and the default is **200**.

The value provided by `next_cursor` is always a string, and should be considered opaque; the implementation is subject to change. If less than `count` entities are returned in the current page of the result set, the `next_cursor` value will be `null`.

**Note:** the analytics endpoints do not support this style of pagination. Paging on the stats endpoints is supported by specifying periods of time. See the documentation of those individual endpoints for more information.
