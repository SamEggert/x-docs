title: What to build
---

## Introduction

Our developer community has unique skills, experiences, and perspectives that can fill gaps, solve problems, and seed new innovation on X well beyond what we at X can do on our own. We encourage you to build tools and products that make X better, healthier, and extend the public conversation. In particular, we want to see innovation in the following categories:

- [Moderate conversations for health and safety](#moderate)
- [Enable creation and personal expression](#enable)
- [Measure and analyze what's happening](#measure)
- [Improve community experiences](#improve)
- [Curate and recommend content](#curate)
- [Impact the greater good](#impact)

### Moderate conversations for health and safety

We want everyone to feel comfortable, safe, and excited to participate in the conversation on X. We've worked hard to offer tools that give people more control over their experience, like Post reply settings, blocks, and mutes. However, there will always be more work to do, and we want to encourage you to build complementary or additive solutions that help improve the health and safety of the platform. Check out some of our resources below to help you get started:

Relevant endpoints:

- [Follows](/x-api/users/follows/introduction)
- [Blocks](/x-api/users/blocks/introduction)
- [Mutes](/x-api/users/mutes/introduction)
- [Hide replies](/x-api/posts/hide-replies/introduction)
- [Manage Posts](/x-api/posts/manage-tweets/introduction) (Post reply settings)

### Enable creation and personal expression

X is where people come to share their perspective, ideas, and passions. It's the convergence of individuals and brands, founders and athletes, celebrities and CEOs. Developers have an opportunity to build creative solutions that allow people on X to expand their reach, express themselves in new ways, and connect with like minded communities. As creators and innovators themselves, developers can also build things that broaden how people experience X like helpful bots, gamification, or cross-posted content. Below are a few ideas to seed your innovation:

Relevant endpoints:

- [Manage Posts](/x-api/posts/manage-tweets/introduction)
- [Spaces](/x-api/spaces/introduction)
- [Retweets](/x-api/posts/retweets/introduction)

### Measure and analyze "what's happening"

Many people come to X because of the opportunity it presents to reach new or existing audiences, amplify their voice, or have an impact. Developers can help these creators, artists, businesses, and local advocates measure, analyze, or understand the impact of their content. Additionally, developers can build new solutions that help people derive insights from the public conversation about trends, their audience, and so much more. We've put together a few resources below to help you get started:

Relevant endpoints/functionality:

- [Object model](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary) (Posts, Users, Spaces, etc)
- [Advanced metrics](/x-api/fundamentals/metrics)
- [Post annotations](/x-api/fundamentals/post-annotations)
- [Search Posts](/x-api/posts/search/introduction)
- [Posts counts](/x-api/posts/counts/introduction)
- [Filtered stream](/x-api/posts/filtered-stream/introduction)
- [Sampled stream](/x-api/posts/volume-streams/introduction)

### Improve community experiences

As new communities grow and convene on X, we want developers to use their expertise to help serve the unique needs of these communities. X is home of the global conversation, and we want everyone to be able to participate regardless of their language, timezone, cultural differences, or other localized needs. Additionally, we want growing communities around topics like finance or gaming to have tools built for their unique experiences and needs.

### Curate and recommend content

Developers have always come up with creative ways to connect people on X to content they're interested in. Whether it's apps, bots, or other tools that help people have more curated or customized experiences, this is an opportunity for developers to connect people to the content they care most about.
