### Manage List members: Standard v1.1 compared to X API v2

If you have been working with the standard v1.1 [POST lists/members/create](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/post-lists-members-create) and [POST lists/members/destroy](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/post-lists-members-destroy) endpoints, the goal of this guide is to help you understand the similarities and differences between the standard v1.1 and X API v2 manage List members endpoints.

* **Similarities**
    * Authentication
* **Differences**
    * Endpoint URLs
    * App and Project requirements
    * HTTP methods
    * Rate limits
    * Request parameters

#### Similarities

**Authentication**

Both endpoint versions support [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/resources/fundamentals/authentication). Therefore, if you were previously using one of the standard v1.1 manage List member endpoints, you can continue using the same authentication method if you migrate to the X API v2 version.

#### Differences

**Endpoint URLs**

* Standard v1.1 endpoints:
    * POST https://api.x.com/1.1/lists/members/create.json
        (Adds a member to a specified List)
    * POST https://api.x.com/1.1/lists/members/destroy.json
        (Removes a member from a specified List)
* X API v2 endpoint:
    * POST https://api.x.com/2/lists/:id/members
        (Adds a member to a specified List)

    * DELETE https://api.x.com/2/lists/:id/members/:user_id
        (Removes a member from a specified List)

**Rate limits**

| **Standard v1.1** | **X API v2** |
| :--- | :--- |
| /1.1/lists/members/create.json<br/><br/>none | /2/lists/:id/members<br/><br/>300 requests per 15-minute window with OAuth 1.0a User Context<br/><br/>300 requests per 15-minute window with OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE |
| /1.1/lists/members/destroy.json<br/><br/>none | /2/lists/:id/members/:user_id<br/><br/>300 requests per 15-minute window with OAuth 1.0a User Context<br/><br/>300 requests per 15-minute window with OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE |

**App and Project requirements**

The X API v2 endpoints require that you use credentials from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is associated with a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) when authenticating your requests. All X API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps related to a project.

**Request parameters**

The following standard v1.1 request parameters have equivalents in X API v2:

| **Standard v1.1** | **X API v2** |
| :--- | :--- |
| list_id | id  |
| slug | No equivalent |
| screen_name | No equivalent |
| owner\_screen\_name | No equivalent |
| owner_id | No equivalent |
