A media object represents a single photo, video or animated GIF. Media objects are used by many endpoints within the X API, and may be included in Posts, Direct Messages, user profiles, advertising creatives and elsewhere. Each media object may have multiple display or playback variants, with different resolutions or formats.

## Media types & size restrictions

Size restrictions for uploading via API 

- **Image**: `5 MB`
- **GIF**: `15 MB`
- **Video**: `512 MB` (when using `media_category=amplify_video`)

## Creation

Objects such as Posts, Direct Messages, user profile pictures, hosted Ads cards, etc. can contain one or more media objects. These top-level objects are collectively known as entities. The relevant entity creation API (e.g. [`POST /2/tweets`](/x-api/posts/creation-of-a-post)) can be passed one or more media objects using a unique `media_id`.

An entity which contains media object(s) can be created by following these steps:

1. Upload the media file(s) using either the recommended [chunked](/x-api-/media/quickstart/media-upload-chunked) upload (images/GIF/video), or the older [simple](/x-api/media-upload/media-upload) upload (images only).
1. Receive a `media_id` from step 1. This step may be repeated multiple times with different media if the entity allows multiple `media_id` parameters to be passed in.
1. Create the entity by calling the appropriate endpoint, including the `media_id` and other required parameters. For example, attach a `media_id` to a Post using the [`POST /2/tweets`](/x-api/posts/creation-of-a-post) endpoint.
