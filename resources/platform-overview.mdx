## Get started with the X Developer Platform

X Developer Platform enables you to harness the power of X's open, global, real-time and historical platform within your own applications. The platform provides tools, resources, data and API products for you to integrate, and expand X's impact through research, solutions and more.

This section can help you get acquainted with the platform’s organization.

### How the platform is organized

The X developer platform is organized into three different products.

We have put together a different getting started section for each of these product pages since they have different requirements. 
 

#### X API

The X API is a set of programmatic endpoints that can be used to understand or build the conversation on X. 

This API allows you to find and retrieve, engage with, or create a variety of different resources including the following:

-   Tweets
-   Users
-   Spaces
-   Direct Messages
-   Lists
-   Trends
-   Media
-   Places

<div className="flex space-x-2">

</Button>

<Button href="/x-api/getting-started/make-your-first-request">

</Button>

#### X Ads API

The Twitter Ads API is the direct connection to the Twitter Ads platform.

Integrate with the X Ads API to enhance the X Ads experience with additional innovation and efficiencies for your business.

*   Create, schedule, and manage ad campaigns
*   Create targeting criteria and custom audiences
*   Plan and create ad creatives

To apply for X Ads API access, a developer account with Elevated access is required.

#### X for Websites

X for Websites allows you to embed X's live content into your product, direct from the source. Make the most out of X on your website to increase followers, drive engagement, and grow your business

Bring your pick of content from X into your website or app. Use our tools to embed Tweets in your stories and articles on the web.

Include a stream of Tweets in your website or app in a compact, linear view. Configure Tweet timelines to automatically display live updates from people, trends, and places right in your app.

Allow people who visit your website or app to engage with your X account and share content with their followers. Enhance links to your website shared on X with Cards and X buttons.

### Documentation organization

Our technical documentation has separate sections to help you work with each of these different products. In each section, you will find guides, libraries, API references, and other resources to help you get started.

The [X API](/x-api/introduction) and [X Ads API](/x-ads-api/introduction) products share similar fundamentals, and even include some common endpoint functionality. These shared concepts are discussed in the platform fundamentals section, including the following:
