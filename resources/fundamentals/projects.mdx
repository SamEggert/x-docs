## Introduction

Projects allow you to organize your work based on how you intend to use the X API so you can effectively manage your access to the API and monitor your usage. Each Project can contain one or multiple [Apps](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/apps) depending on your access level (described later on this page). You will use these Apps to generate [authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/authentication) credentials such as [API Keys and Secrets](https://developer.twitter.com/resources/fundamentals/authentication/api-key-and-secret), user [Access Tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/resources/fundamentals/authentication/obtaining-user-access-tokens), and [App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens).

While you can use these keys and tokens from any App to access the X API or X Ads API (you must [apply for additional access](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/apply) to use the Ads API), you must use keys and tokens from an App associated with a Project to be able to use the [X API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/resources/fundamentals/projects) endpoints.

If you have a developer account, you can view and manage your Projects on the [Projects & Apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps) page within the developer portal. [Sign up](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info) for an account if you don't have one already.

### Projects and X API access levels

At this time, there are 4 different tiers of access that are applied at the Project-level:

- Free
- Basic
- Pro
- Enterprise

To learn more about what each of these access levels provides, please visit the [about X API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-level) page.

You can only have one Project with either Free, Basic, or Pro.

We will describe a few Project-specific differences here for you:

#### Free

This access tier is provided to anyone who has [signed up](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info) for a developer account.

Number of Apps within that Project: 1
[Tweet consumption cap](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps): 1,500 Tweets per month

Authentication methods:

- [OAuth 2.0 with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)
- App only

#### Basic

This access tier is provided to anyone who has subscribed for Basic access via the developer portal.

Number of Apps within that Project: 2
[Tweet consumption cap](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps): 10,000 Tweets per month
Authentication methods:

- [OAuth 2.0 with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)

- App only

#### Pro

This access tier is provided to anyone who has subscribed for Pro access via the developer portal.

Number of Apps within that Project: 3
[Tweet consumption cap](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps): 1 million Tweets per month

Authentication methods:

- [OAuth 2.0 with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)
- [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.twitter.com/resources/fundamentals/authentication)
- App only

#### Enterprise

This access tier is provided to anyone who has applied for Enterprise, been approved by our team, and signed a monthly auto renew contract via X account manager. [Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO3bczKWO2jFHyVZJUSEGfdyfFaqt2MvmOfl_aJp0KxMqtDA/viewform).

Number of Apps within that Project: 3+
[Tweet consumption cap](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweet-caps): 50 million+ Tweets per month

Authentication methods:

- [OAuth 2.0 with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code)
- [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.twitter.com/resources/fundamentals/authentication)
- App only

### Tweet caps and Projects

Tweet consumption caps apply at the Project-level, effectively limiting the volume of Tweets you can retrieve from certain X API v2 endpoints within a given month.

### Configuring Projects

#### Creating a Project

To create a Project, click on "New Project" in your [dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) or the [Projects & Apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps) page within the developer portal. You'll only be able to see this option if you haven't already created a Project. You will be prompted to create a Project name, description, and use case. You will also be asked to create a new App or connect an existing standalone App.

#### Creating or Connecting an App for your Project

If your Project doesn't include an App, you can add one by clicking on the Project name in the dashboard. From there, you can either create a new App or select an existing standalone App to connect to your Project. The App is where you can generate the authentication keys and tokens listed at the beginning of this guide.

#### Editing a Project

To edit a Project, click on the name of your Project from the dashboard or Projects & Apps page within the developer portal. From there you will see the details of your Project and can select "edit" to make changes.

### Standalone Apps

Standalone Apps are Apps that exist outside of the Project structure. The authentication credentials associated with these standalone Apps can make successful requests to X's API's standard v1.1, premium v1.1, enterprise, or to the X Ads API. Standalone Apps will fail when trying to make requests to the X API v2 endpoints unless you connect them to a Project.

If you created an App before August 2020, they will be visible in the "Standalone Apps" section of the developer portal under [Projects & Apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps). You will be limited to ten Apps in total, including those that are connected to your Project.

If you're part of a team account, you will see the Apps that you own under Standalone Apps. If a teammate owns an App that's part of a Project, you will be able to see the App's name and owner's info, but you will not be able to change its settings, access its keys and tokens, or regenerate its keys and tokens. You should contact the App owner to make any changes to their App.
