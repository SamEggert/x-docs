## Important concepts

### Gnip Console

You can manage your enterprise products and account access via the [Gnip Console](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/overview). 


### Enrichments

We’ve added metadata to the response payload of the premium APIs for developers who are using a paid tier. Learn more about expanded URLs, poll data, and profile geo by visiting our [enrichments section](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/data-enrichments).
 

### Advanced filtering tools

The Premium Search API makes available an advanced set of operators that are not available with the standard search endpoint. Many of these operators are available to the free sandbox users, but you will get a more robust set of operators if you are using a paid tier. Learn more by visiting our [rules and filters section](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/rules-filtering#getting-started-with-enterprise-rules-and-queries).
