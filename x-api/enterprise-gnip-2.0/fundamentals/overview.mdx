## Overview

>The enterprise console (at console.gnip.com) is available to enterprise data customers with contracted enterprise API access. If you are not currently an enterprise data customer but would like more information, you can learn more about [enterprise data](https://developer.x.com/en/products/x-api/enterprise) here.

This is an overview of X's enterprise console dashboard. The sections that are covered pertain to each specific area of the console for product details, usage, and general account management. If you have any questions regarding your specific account, please contact your designated account manager, or review our [technical documentation for enterprise products](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/enterprise-gnip).

As part of the enterprise trial and onboarding process with your account manager, enterprise customers will receive a login to [console.gnip.com](http://console.gnip.com), which is the user interface where enterprise product access can be reviewed and configured. Initial access to the console for customer admin is set up by X as part of the enterprise onboarding process, and admins can then add additional users. The enterprise console allows you to manage and access more details related to your enterprise products. 

The following video provides an overview of the various portions of the console.gnip.com dashboard. 

**Disclaimer: Please note that some of the features shown in the video, including certain stream enrichments and non-X data source products, may no longer be available.**

## Products tab

Upon logging into your account at [console.gnip.com](http://console.gnip.com), you will land on the products tab of the dashboard.  This page includes an overview of the enterprise products currently available on your account.

For products using streaming delivery like PowerTrack or Decahose, this page lists the product name, and stream label,  the number of current active connections, the number of rules currently active for each (where applicable), and the raw count of activities (for example, Posts) delivered in the most recent 24 hours.

For products with REST delivery, like Search API, this page lists the product name,labels (also shown as "streams"), current activities (for example, Posts) returned through these endpoints, and a few different request counts per endpoint.

Note that the [Usage API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/usage) delivers much of this data programatically.

Specific details per stream are available by clicking the name, or the settings button.

### Overview

Clicking on one of the streams in the main dashboard will take you to an overview page for that stream.

For streaming delivery products, this page includes the following:

1.  A volume chart of the number of activities being delivered to you through each specific stream connection 

2.  Details (connection ID and IP address) on currently active connections on the stream 

3.  A log of recent connection, disconnection, and rule-update events for your stream


Note that the scale of the chart may be adjusted with the links in the top-right corner. The visibility of individual connections and disconnections can be toggled by clicking the appropriate key in the legend directly below the chart.

### Connections

The Connections page provides details on recent connection events on your stream. This includes the start and end times for each connection (in 24 hour UTC), the duration of each connection, the IP of the server that made the connection, a unique connection ID for reference purposes, and the current connection status. The status corresponds to the most recent event for the specified connection – i.e. Client Connected, or a disconnect, with the type of disconnect specified.   For more details on connection debugging, visit the [disconnections explained guide](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api#integrating-with-powertrack).

### API Help

The API Help page provides the API endpoint URLs for your stream, as well as the Rules API endpoint for the stream, where applicable. In addition, it includes sample curl commands and instructions on how to connect to the stream endpoint, and how to programmatically add, delete, and list rules from your stream's Rules API endpoint.

### Rules

The Rules tab is available for PowerTrack streams, and provides a quick way to get started by manually entering plain text rules via a user interface. Note that the interface only supports adding up to 1000 rules via this manual method, and should be only used for initial testing. We recommend managing your rules programmatically via the [Rules API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api#api-reference-index) in any production setting.

### Settings

The Settings tab allows you to switch the output format of the data in your stream, where multiple format options are supported. To switch the format, just use the radio buttons indicating the different options. The change will take effect upon reconnecting to the stream.  Note that updating this setting will take place immediately on the next request or connection and may break your parser with the new format. 

**Please note:** The recommended setting for getting the most data is "Leave data in the original format" which will return data in the enriched native format [here](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/data-dictionary#post-object).  Activity streams format is described [here](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/data-dictionary#activity-object).

## Usage tab

The Usage Tab provides insight into your use of your streams over various time periods. For programmatic access to usage information, see the [Usage API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/usage).

### Monthly

The Monthly Usage page displays your stream usage broken down by product. For example, coverage products (for example, PowerTrack, Historical PowerTrack, and PowerTrack Replay) for a given data source will be grouped together to provide separate data, as well as a combined roll-up count. The counts include a current month-to-date, estimated end-of-month (based on this month’s usage so far, and remaining time in the month), and the previous two months’ counts.

Notably, these counts are deduplicated for each product and stream. If you received the same Post through multiple connections to the same PowerTrack stream, that Post will be counted once for these purposes. Counts will be updated every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC.

### Daily

The Daily Usage page provides daily deduplicated counts for each day in the current month, broken down by product. Counts are updated every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC.

### Rules

Rule limits are based on your contracted PowerTrack rule package and are applied across all streams of a given "type". Counts are updated whenever a new rule is added or deleted.

## Account tab

### My Profile

View details about your individual user profile, and change your password here. Additionally, you may configure account usage threshold notices specific to your account.  API status notices are available through the status page at https://api.twitterstat.us.

### Account Settings

You may add, remove, and edit users, and configure email notifications for individual users and usage threshold alerts.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/account-settings.png.twimg.1920.png"/>
</Frame>
Please note that there are three types of users – Account Admin, User, and Email Only.  

*   Account admins are allowed to create/delete/edit other users, and can use basic authentication with username (email) and password to connect to the enterprise APIs

*   Users cannot create or modify other users, but can use basic authentication with username (email) and password to connect to the enterprise APIs

*   Email Only users do not have access to the dashboard, are not authorized to connect to the enterprise APIs  and only receive notifications, if they are configured to receive them in the Notifications section.


### Usage Thresholds

Configure volume thresholds for your products. These will initiate email alerts for the users who have configured those notifications in their profiles, both for the warning threshold and critical threshold for each product.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/usage-thresholds.png.twimg.1920.png"/>

Please note that these thresholds are evaluated once per day at 19:30 (UTC), and are not evaluated in real-time.
