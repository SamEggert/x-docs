## Getting started with enterprise rules and queries


Products utilizing enterprise operators deliver social data to you based on filtering rules you set up. Rules are made up of one or more ‘clauses’, where a clause is a keyword, exact phrase, or one of the many enterprise operators. Before beginning to build rules with enterprise operators, be sure to review the syntax described below, look through the list of available operators, and understand the restrictions around building rules. You should also be sure to understand the nuances of how rules are evaluated logically, in the "[Order of operations](#orderofoperations)" section.

Multiple clauses can be combined with both "and" and "or" logic.

**Please note:** "And" logic is specified with a space between clauses, while or logic is specified with an upper-case `OR`. 

Each rule can be up to 2,048 characters long with no limits on the number of positive clauses (things you want to match or filter on) and negative clauses (things you want to exclude and not match on).
 

### Building rules and queries 

**Keyword match**

Keyword matches are similar to queries in a search interface. For example, the following enterprise operator rule would match activities with the term "social" in the text body.

`social`

**ANDing terms with white space**

Adding another keyword is the same as adding another requirement for finding matches. For example, this rule would only match activities where both "social" and "media" were present in the text, in either order – _having a space between terms operates as boolean AND logic_. If you include an explicit AND in your rule, it will rejected by the rules endpoint.

`social media`

**ORing terms with upper-case OR**

Many situations actually call for boolean OR logic, however. This is easily accomplished as well. _Note that the OR operator must be upper-case and a lower-case ‘or’ will be treated as a regular keyword._

`social OR data`

**Negating terms**

Still other scenarios might call for excluding results with certain keywords (a boolean NOT logic). For instance, activities with ‘happy’, but excluding any with ‘birthday’ in the text.

`social -personality`

**Grouping with parentheses**

These types of logic can be combined using grouping with parentheses, and expanded to much more complex queries.

`(social OR data) (academic OR research) -personality -information -university`

This is just the beginning though – while the above examples rely simply on tokenized matching for keywords, enterprise products also offer operators to perform different types of matching on the text.

**Exact match**

`"social media research"`

**Substring match**

`contains:info`

**Proximity match**

`"social media research"~3`


Further, other operators allow you to filter on unique aspects of social data, besides just the text. 

**The user who is posting a Post**

`from:XDeveloeprs`

**Geo-tagged Tweets within 10 miles of Pearl St. in Boulder, CO, United States**

`point_radius:[-105.27346517 40.01924738 10.0mi]`

**Putting it all together**

These can be combined with text filters using the same types of logic described above.

`(social OR data) (academic OR research OR "social media research") point_radius:[-105.27346517 40.01924738 10.0mi] lang:en -personality -information -university`

### Boolean Syntax

The examples in the previous section, utilized various types of boolean logic and grouping. See the table below for additional detail regarding the syntax and requirements for each.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Logic type** | **Operator syntax** | Description |
| AND | social data | Whitespace between two operators results in AND logic between them  <br/>  <br/>Matches activities containing both keywords ("social", "data").  <br/>  <br/>**Do not use AND explicitly in your rule. Only use whitespace. An explicit AND will be treated like a regular keyword.** |
| OR  | social OR data | To OR together two operators, insert an all-caps OR, enclosed in whitespace between them  <br/>  <br/>Matches activities with EITHER keyword ("social" OR "data")  <br/>  <br/>Note that if you combine OR and AND functionality in a single rule, you should understand the order of operations described in our "[Order of operations](#OrderOfOperations)" section, and consider grouping non-negated operators together using parentheses as described below to ensure your rule behaves as expected.  <br/>  <br/>You must use upper-case "OR" in your rule. Lower-case 'or' will be treated as a regular keyword. |
| NOT | social data  <br/>-apple -android -phone | Insert a `-` character immediately in front of the operator or group of operators.  <br/>  <br/>The example rule shown matches activities containing keyword "social", but excludes those which contain the keyword "data."  <br/>  <br/>Negated ORs are not allowed where the rule would request "everything in the firehose except the negation." For example, `apple OR -ipad` is invalid because it would match all activities except those mentioning "ipad". |
| Grouping | (social OR data) -XDeveloeprs -api | Parentheses around multiple operators create a functional "group".<br/><br/>Groups can be connected to clauses in the same manner as an individual clause via whitespace (AND) or ORs. However, note that it is a best practice to not group together negations by applying the negating - to the entire group. Instead, you should negate each individual operator, stringing them together via whitespace (AND). <br/><br/>For example, instead of using -(iphone OR imac OR macbook), use the following: -iphone -imac -macbook  <br/>  <br/>Grouping is especially important where a single rule combines AND and OR functionality, due to the order of operations used to evaluate the rule. See below for more details. |

**Please note:** that operators may be either positive or negative.

**Positive Operators** define what you want to **include** in the results. E.g. the `has:hashtags` operator says “I want activities containing hashtags.”

**Negative Operators** define what you want to **exclude** from the results, and are created by using the Boolean NOT logic described above. For example, `-has:hashtags` says “Exclude any activities containing hashtagss, even if they otherwise match my rule.”

Premum operator products have no restriction on the number of positive and negative clauses, subject to a maximum length of 2,048 characters.
 

#### Order of Operations

When combining AND and OR functionality in a single rule, the following order of operations will dictate how your rule is evaluated.

1.  Operators connected by AND logic are combined first
2.  Then, operators connected with OR logic are applied

**Example:**

* `apple OR iphone ipad` would be evaluated as `apple OR (iphone ipad)`
* `ipad iphone OR android` would be evaluated as `(iphone ipad) OR android`

To eliminate uncertainty and ensure that your rules are evaluated as intended, group terms together with parentheses where appropriate. For example:

* `(apple OR iphone) ipad`
* `iphone (ipad OR android)`

#### Punctuation, Diacritics, and Case Sensitivity

If you specify a keyword or hashtag rule with character accents or diacritics for enterprise operators, it will match Post text honoring the diacritics (hashtags or keywords). Rule with a keyword `Diacr**í**tica` or hashtag `#cumplea**ñ**os` will match "Diacr**í**tica" or "#cumplea**ñ**os" but not "Diacritica" or "#cumpleanos" without the tilde **í** or **eñe**.

Characters with accents or diacritics are treated the same as normal characters and are not treated as word boundaries. For example, a rule of cumplea**ñ**os would only match activities containing the word cumpleaños and would not match activities containing cumplea, cumplean, or os.

All operators are evaluated in a case-insensitive manner. For example, the rule `Cat` will match all of the following: "cat", "CAT", "Cat".

#### PowerTrack rule tags

As described on our "[Matching rules](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/data-enrichments#matching-rules)" page, each rule may be created with a tag. These tags have no effect on filtering, but can be used to create logical groupings of rules within your app. Each rule may have only one tag, with a maximum of 255 characters. Tags are included with the JSON formatted rule at the time of creation via the API, as described on our "Matching rules" page.

#### Putting Rules in JSON Format

In order to add or delete a rule from a stream via the API, the rules must utilize JSON format. Essentially, this requires putting each rule into the following structure:

`{"value":"insert_rule_here"}`

**Rules with double-quotes**

If the rule contains double-quote characters (`“`) associated with exact-match or other operators, they must be escaped using a backslash to distinguish them from the structure of the JSON format.

`"social data" @XDevelopers`

The JSON formatted rule would be:

`{"value":"\"social data\" @XDevelopers"}`

**Rules with double-quote string literals**

To include a double-quote character as a string literal within an exact-match, it must be double-escaped. For example, for a rule matching on the exact phrase "Toys “R” Us", including the double-quotes around "R", the plain-text representation of this would look like the following:

`"Toys \"R\" Us"`

Translating this to JSON format, you should use the following structure:

`{"value":"\"Toys \\\"R\\\" Us\""}`

**Rules with Tags**

To include an optional tag with your rule, as described above, simply include an additional `tag` field with the rule value.

`{"value":"\"social data\" @XDevelopers","tag":"RULE-TAG-01"}`

**Formatting for API Requests**

When adding or deleting rules from the stream via the API, multiple JSON formatted rules should be comma delimited, and wrapped in a JSON “rules” array, as shown below:

`{"rules":[{"value":"from:XDevelopers"},{"value":"\social data\" @XDevelopers","tag":"RULE-TAG-01"}]}`

#### Operators that match Quote Tweets

When using the [PowerTrack API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api) and [Historical PowerTrack API](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/enterprise/historical-powertrack-api), the operators below will match on content from both the original Post that was quoted and the new Quote Tweet.

However, if you are using the [Search API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/search-api), these operators will only match the contents of the Quote Tweet, and will not match on any content from the original Post that was quoted.

* `Keywords`
* `Phrases`
* `Proximity`
* `#hashtags`
* `@mentions`
* `$cashtags`
* `url:`
* `url_contains:`
* `has:links`
* `has:mentions`
* `has:hashtags`
* `has:media`
* `has:symbols`
* `is:quote`
* `is:reply`

## Enterprise operators

Below are the operators available with PowerTrack and Historical PowerTrack. A subset of these are available with the 30-Day and Full-Archive search APIs. See [this table](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/rules-filtering#operators-by-product) for a product-by-product list of available operators.

| keyword                   | Matches a keyword within the text body or URL of a Post. Keywords must start with either a digit (0-9) or any non-punctuation character.<br/>Keyword matching is tokenized, meaning the keyword is matched against tokenized text of the Post body.<br/>For strings with punctuation (e.g., "coca-cola"), use a quoted "exact phrase match".<br/>_Example_: `(social OR pizza OR wildfire) -planet`                                                                                                                                                       |
| emoji                     | Matches an emoji within the body of a Post, using tokenized matching based on punctuation, symbol/emoji, and separator characters.<br/>If an emoji has a variant, use quotes for exact matches.<br/>_Example_: `(🍕 OR 💜 OR 🐢) -🤖`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| "exact phrase match"      | Matches an exact phrase within the body of a Post. Punctuation is treated as whitespace.<br/>_Example_: `("social media" OR "developer.x.com" OR "wildfire911" OR "coca-cola") -"planet earth"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| #                         | Matches any Post with the specified hashtag. This is an exact match, meaning `#2016` will match posts with `#2016` but not `#2016election`.<br/>_Example_: `(#social OR #pizza OR #2016election) -#planet`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| @                         | Matches any Post mentioning the specified username.<br/>_Example_: `(@XDevelopers OR @api OR @twittereng) -@jack`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| "keyword1 keyword2"~N     | Proximity operator that matches a Post where keywords are within N tokens of each other.<br/>Keywords in reverse order can be no more than N-2 tokens apart. N cannot be greater than 6.<br/>_Example_: `"social media"~5 OR "API"~3`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Operators by product
### Rules and filtering: Enterprise

All enterprise operators are available with PowerTrack and Historical PowerTrack APIs. However, only a subset of operators are available to the enterprise Search APIs, as noted on this page.

The dark blue tags note which operators are available to different enterprise products:

PowerTrack Search

| Operator | Product | Description | Matches on payload element |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "exact phrase match" | PowerTrack<br/><br/>Search | Matches an exact phrase within the body of a Post.<br/><br/>Components that can translate into a search operators will be treated as words. In other words:<br/><br/>* `"#hashtag"` will match `hashtag` but not `#hashtag` (use the [hashtag operator](#hashtag-operator) without quotes to match on actual hashtags) <br/>* `"$TWTR"` will match the word `TWTR` but not the cashtag `$TWTR` (use the [cashtag operator](#cashtag-operator) without quotes to match on actual cashtags)<br/><br/>**Note:** in 30 Day Search and Full Archive Search (Enterprise and Premium), punctuation is not tokenized and is instead treated as whitespace. | `text` |
| @   | PowerTrack<br/><br/>Search | Matches any Post that mentions the given username. The value can be either the username (excluding the `@` character) or the user’s numeric ID or (obtained for example via the [GET users/lookup](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/get-users-lookup) endpoint). | `entities.user_mentions` |
| #   | PowerTrack<br/><br/>Search | Matches any Post with the given hashtag.<br/><br/>This operator performs an exact match. For example meaning the rule `#1989` will match Posts containing the exact hashtag `#1989`, but not those with the hashtag `#TaylorSwift1989`.<br/><br/>**Note:** this operator relies on X's entity extraction to match hashtags, rather than extracting the hashtag from the body itself. For more details on JSON attributes from entities, refer to [X Entities](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/data-dictionary). | `entities.hashtags` |
| $   | PowerTrack<br/><br/>Search | Matches any Post that contains the specified cashtag (where the leading character of the token is `$`).<br/><br/>**Note: **this operator relies on X's entity extraction to match links, rather than extracting the link from the body itself. For more details on JSON attributes from entities, refer to [X Entities](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/data-dictionary). | `entities.symbols` |
| bio: | PowerTrack | _Available alias_: user_bio:<br/><br/>Matches a keyword (using tokenized match) or a phrase within the user bio of a Post. Use double quotes to match a phrase. In other words:<br/><br/>* `bio:software engineer` will match Posts with the keyword `engineer` from users with the word `software` in their bio<br/>* `bio:"software engineer"` will match any Post posted by users with the phrase `software engineer` in their bio | `user``.description` |

| contains: | PowerTrack | Substring match for Posts that have the given substring in the body, regardless of tokenization. In other words, this does a pure substring match and does not consider word boundaries.<br/><br/>Use double quotes to match substrings that contain whitespace or punctuation. | `text` |
| &lt;emoji&gt; | PowerTrack<br/><br/>Search | Matches an emoji within the body of a Post.<br/><br/>This is a tokenized match, so your emoji will be matched against the tokenized text of the Post body.

| keyword | PowerTrack<br/><br/>Search | Matches a keyword within the body of a Post.<br/><br/>This is a tokenized match, meaning that your keyword string will be matched against the tokenized text of the Post body. Tokenization is based on punctuation, symbol/emoji, and separator Unicode basic plane characters. For example, a Post with the text “I like coca-cola” would be split into the following tokens: `I`, `like`, `coca`, `cola`. These tokens would then be compared to the keyword string used in your rule. To match strings containing punctuation (e.g. coca-cola), symbol, or separator characters, you must use an [exact phrase match](#exact-match) operator. | `text` |
| lang: | PowerTrack<br/><br/>Search | Matches Posts that have been classified by X as being of a particular language (if, and only if, the post has been classified). Each Post will be classified with only one language, so AND’ing together multiple languages will yield no results.<br/><br/>**Note: **if no language classification can be made the provided result is `und` (for undefined).<br/><br/>This operator will only match against supported languages. Providing any other value (including `und`) will result in the operator being ignored (in other words, Posts will not be filtered by this operator).
