### Manage Retweets: Standard v1.1 compared to X API v2

If you have been working with the standard v1.1 [POST statuses/retweet/:id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-retweet-id), and [POST statuses/unretweet/:id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-unretweet-id)  endpoints, the goal of this guide is to help you understand the similarities and differences between the standard and X API v2 Retweets endpoints.

* **Similarities**
    * Authentication

    * Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods
    * Request limitations
    * App and Project requirements
    * Request parameters

#### Similarities

**Authentication**

Both the standard v1.1 and X API v2 manage Retweets ([POST statuses/retweet/:id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-retweet-id), and [POST statuses/unretweet/:id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-unretweet-id)) endpoints use [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/resources/fundamentals/authentication). Therefore, if you were previously using one of the standard v1.1 Retweets lookup endpoints, you can continue using the same authentication method if you migrate to the X API v2 version. 

#### Differences

**Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods**

* Standard v1.1 endpoints:
    * https://api.x.com/1.1/statuses/retweet/:id.json
        (Retweets a Post. Returns the original Post with Retweet details embedded)
    * https://api.x.com/1.1/statuses/unretweet/:id.json
        (Undo a Retweet. Returns the original Post with Retweet details embedded)
* X API v2 endpoint:
    * https://api.x.com/2/tweets/:id/retweets
        (Retweets a given Post)
    * https://api.x.com/2/users/:id/retweets/:source\_tweet\_id
        (Undo a Retweet of a given Post) 

**App and Project requirements**

The X API v2 endpoints require that you use credentials from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is associated to a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) when authenticating your requests. All X API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a Project.


**Request parameters**

The following standard v1.1 request parameters accepted two request query parameters (user\_id or screen\_name). The X API v2 only accepts the numerical user ID, and it must be passed as part of the endpoint path.

| Standard v1.1 | X API v2 |
| :--- | :--- |
| **id** | **id** |
| **includes_entities** | No equivalent |

Please note that the Standard v1.1 parameters are passed as query parameters, whereas the X API v2 parameters are passed as body parameters for the POST endpoint or path parameters for the DELETE endpoint.

Also, an id of the user Retweeting a Post is not required when using the standard v1.1 endpoints since the [Access Tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow) passed with [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) infer which user is initiating the Retweet/undoing a Retweet.
