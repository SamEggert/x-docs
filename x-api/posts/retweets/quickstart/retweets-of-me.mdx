The Reposts of Me lookup allows you to see which of your own Posts have been shared by others.

This provides users with insight into which of their Posts are being shared and resonating with their audience, which can help facilitate more targeted interactions and content strategy adjustments.

#### Authentication

Since you are making requests on behalf of a user, you must authenticate these endpoints with either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2), and utilize the user Access Tokens associated with the user you are making the request on behalf of. You can generate this user Access Token using the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.x.com/resources/fundamentals/authentication/obtaining-user-access-tokens) (OAuth 1.0a) or using the [Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-3) (OAuth 2.0).

#### Making a request

Once a user has authenticated with your app, you can call the Retweets of Me API on behalf of user as shown below:

      ```bash
      curl 'https://api.x.com/2/users/reposts_of_me' --header 'Authorization: ••••••'
      ```


If the request is successful, you should see the JSON response as shown below:
