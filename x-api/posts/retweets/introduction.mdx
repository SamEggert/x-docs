**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved [developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is located within a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects). 

Learn more about getting access to the X API v2 endpoints in our [getting started guide](/x-api/getting-started/getting-access).

### Retweets lookup

With the Retweets lookup endpoint, you can retrieve a list of accounts that have Retweeted a Post. For this endpoint, pagination tokens will be provided for paging through large sets of results in batches of up to 100 users. 

You can authenticate these endpoints with either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication), [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com(/resources/fundamentals/authentication#app-only-authentication-and-oauth-2-0-bearer-token), or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://aem-staging.twitter.biz/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code.html). 

### Retweets of Me

The Reposts of Me lookup allows you to see which of your own Posts have been shared by others.

This provides users with insight into which of their Posts are being shared and resonating with their audience, which can help facilitate more targeted interactions and content strategy adjustments.

You can authenticate these endpoints with either either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2).

#### Manage Retweets

The manage Retweets endpoints enable you to Retweet or undo a Retweet of a specified Post on behalf of an authenticated account. For this endpoint group, there are two methods available POST and DELETE. The POST method allows you to Retweet a Post, and the DELETE method will enable you to undo a Retweet of a given Post.

Since you are making requests on behalf of a user, you must authenticate these endpoints with either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2), and utilize the user Access Tokens associated with the user you are making the request on behalf of. You can generate this user Access Token using the [3-legged OAuth flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow) (OAuth 1.0a) or using the [Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#how-to-connect-to-endpoints-using-oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)) (OAuth 2.0). You can Retweet a Post from your account or an account of an authenticated user. With both endpoints, there is a user rate limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes per endpoint.
