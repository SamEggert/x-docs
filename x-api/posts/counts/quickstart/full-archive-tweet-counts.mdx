### Getting started with the full-archive Post counts     endpoint

This quick start guide will help you make your first request to the full-archive Post counts endpoint using Postman, a graphical tool that alows you to make HTTP requests.

If you would like to see sample code in different programming languages, please visit our [X API v2 sample code](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code) GitHub repository. 

<Note>
### Prerequisites

The full-archive Post counts endpoint is currently only available to those that have Pro or Enterprise access. In order to use this endpoint, you must apply for Pro or [Enterprise access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO3bczKWO2jFHyVZJUSEGfdyfFaqt2MvmOfl_aJp0KxMqtDA/viewform). 

In addition to being approved for access, you will need to have a set of [keys and tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) to authenticate your request. You can generate these keys and tokens by following these steps:

* Navigate to your [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) with Enterprise access in the developer portal and make sure you have an associated [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) within that Project.

* Navigate to your App's “Keys and tokens” page to generate the required credentials. Make sure to save all credentials in a secure location.
</Note>
#### Steps to build a full-archive Post counts request

**Step one: Start with a tool or library**

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we are going to use the Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load X API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:

<Button href="https://t.co/twitter-api-postman">
  Add X API v2 to Postman
</Button>

Once you have the X API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the Post counts > Full-archive Post counts request.

**Step two: Authenticate your request**

To properly make a request to the X API, you need to verify that you have permission. To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with the [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#app-only-authentication-and-oauth-2-0-bearer-token) authentication methods.

You must add your keys and tokens, specifically the [App Access Token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#using-and-generating-an-app-only-bearer-token) (also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named “X API v2” in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the "initial value" and "current value" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).

This variable will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.
 

**Step three: Create a query**

Each full-archive Post counts request requires a single [query](/x-api/posts/counts/integrate/build-a-query). For this example, we are going to use a query that matches on Posts posted by the @XDevelopers account. For this query we use the from operator and set it to XDevelopers (case insensitive):

`from:XDevelopers`

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and enter this ID, or a string of Post IDs separated by a comma, into the "Value" column of the `ids` parameter.
 

| Key | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `query` | `from:XDevelopers` | Query to submit to the full-archive Post counts endpoint |


Step four (optional): Specify the granularity and time period

If you click the ‘Send’ button after step three, you will get the default full-archive Post counts: by hour for the last 30 days. If you want to get full-archive Post counts by day, you will have to add the granularity parameter with a value of day. If you want Post counts for more than 30 days ago, you will have to specify the start_time and end_time parameters with the desired values. 

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and add the following key:value pair to the "Query Params" table:

|     |     |     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key** | **Value** | **Description** |
| granularity | day | The granularity for the Post counts results. Possible values are day, hour or minute |
| start_time | 2021-05-01T00:00:00Z | The oldest UTC timestamp from which the Posts will be provided |
| end_time | 2021-06-01T00:00:00Z | The oldest UTC timestamp from which the Posts will be provided. |


You should now see the following URL next to the "Send" button:

      `https://api.x.com/2/tweets/counts/all?query=from%3AXDevelopers&start_time=2021-05-01T00:00:00Z&end_time=2021-06-01T00:00:00Z&granularity=day`


**Step five: Make your request and review your response**

Once you have everything set up, hit the "Send" button and you will receive a response similar to the following:

```

   ],
   "meta": {
       "total_tweet_count": 22
   }
}
```


**Step six: Paginate through your results**

If the ‘meta’ object in your response also contains next_token, you can pass its value to the next_token query parameter.

| Key | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| next_token | You will add the next_token that you pull from your previous request's meta object and add it here. | If your latest request does not deliver the remainder of the results, you will receive a next_token in the meta object. You will pull the value of that field and add it as the value of the next_token parameter in your next request, holding all other request parameters constant. |

Once you have the right value for next_token set, hit the "Send" button and you will receive the next page of results.
