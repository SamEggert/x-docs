### Getting started with the recent Post counts endpoint

This quick start guide will help you make your first request to the recent Post counts endpoint using Postman, a graphical tool that allows you to send HTTP requests.

If you would like to see sample code in different programming languages, please visit our [X API v2 sample code](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code) GitHub repository. 

<Note>
### Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need to have a set of [keys and tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) to authenticate your request. You can generate these keys and tokens by following these steps:

* [Sign up for a developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/apply-for-access) and receive approval.
* Create a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) and an associated [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) in the developer portal.
* Navigate to your App's “Keys and tokens” page to generate the required credentials. Make sure to save all credentials in a secure location.

#### Steps to build a recent Post counts request

**Step one: Start with a tool or library**

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we are going to use the Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load X API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:

<Button href="https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/9956214-784efcda-ed4c-4491-a4c0-a26470a67400">
  Add X API v2 to Postman
</Button>

Once you have the X API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the Post counts > Recent Post counts request.

**Step two: Authenticate your request**

To properly make a request to the X API, you need to verify that you have permission. To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with the [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#app-only-authentication-and-oauth-2-0-bearer-token) authentication methods.

You must add your keys and tokens, specifically the [App Access Token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#using-and-generating-an-app-only-bearer-token) (also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named “X API v2” in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the "initial value" and "current value" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).

This variable will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.
 

**Step three: Create a query**

Each recent Post counts request requires a single[query](/x-api/posts/counts/integrate/build-a-query). For this example, we are going to use a query that matches on Posts posted by the @XDevelopers account. For this query we use the from: operator and set it to XDevelopers (case insensitive):

`from:XDevelopers`

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and enter this ID, or a string of Post IDs separated by a comma, into the "Value" column of the `ids` parameter.

|     |     |     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key** | **Value** | **Description** |
| `query` | from:XDevelopers | Query to submit to the recent Post counts endpoint |

**Step four (optional): Specify the granularity of the request**

If you click the ‘Send’ button after step three, you will get the default recent Post counts: by hour for the last seven days. If you want to get recent Post counts by day, you will have to add the granularity parameter with a value of day.

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and day into the "Value" column of the granularity parameter.

|     |     |     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key** | **Value** | **Description** |
| granularity | day | The granularity for the Post counts results. Possible values are day, hour or minute |


You should now see the following URL next to the "Send" button:

      `https://api.x.com/2/tweets/counts/recent?query=from%3AXDevelopers&granularity=day`


**Step five: Make your request and review your response**

Once you have everything set up, hit the "Send" button and you will receive the following response:
