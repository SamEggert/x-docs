## Comparing X API’s Post counts endpoints

The v2 Post counts endpoint will eventually replace the [enterprise Search API’s counts endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/search-api/api-reference/enterprise-search). If you have code, apps, or tools that use an older version of a Post counts endpoint and are considering migrating to the newer X API v2 endpoints, then this guide is for you.

This page contains two comparison tables:

* [Recent Post counts](#recent)
* [Full-archive Post counts](#full-archive)
* [Filtering operator comparison](#operator)

### Recent Post counts comparison

The enterprise version of the Post counts endpoints allow you to pull counts for either 30 days or from the full-archive. Therefore, the v2 recent Post counts endpoint, which looks at a 7 day time period, is not a direct replacement for either of the aforementioned endpoints.

However, to help with comparisons, we will look at how the v2 recent Post counts endpoint compares to the enterprise 30-day endpoint.

The following table compares the various types of recent Post counts endpoints:

| **Description** | **Enterprise** | **X API v2** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host domain | https://gnip-api.x.com | https://api.x.com |
| Endpoint path | /search/30day/accounts/:account_name/:label/counts.json | /2/tweets/counts/recent |

### Full-archive Post counts comparison

The following table compares the various types of full-archive search endpoints:

| Description | Enterprise | X API v2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host domain | https://gnip-api.x.com | https://api.x.com |
| Endpoint path | /search/fullarchive/accounts/:account_name/:label/counts | /2/tweets/counts/all |

| Timestamp format | YYYYMMDDHHMM | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ  <br/>[ISO 8601 / RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) |
| Returns Post counts that are no older than | The full archive since March 2006 | The full archive since March 2006 |
| HTTP methods supported | GET  <br/>POST | GET |
| Default request rate limits | The per minute rate limit will vary by partner as specified in your contract.  <br/>20 requests per sec | 300 requests per 15 min per App  <br/>1 request per 1 sec per App |
| Granularity | Day, hour, minute | Day, hour, minute |

### Filtering operator comparison

The two different versions (enterprise, and v2) of Post counts differ in which operators are available, and also have varying levels of operator availability within each version, which are explained below.

Enterprise

* There are no sub-tiers of enterprise operators. All enterprise operators are available to all enterprise users.



X API v2

* **Core:** These operators are available to any v2 user.
* **Advanced:** These operators are only available to users that have been approved for Academic Research access.



You can learn more about each of these sets of operators in their respective guides:

* [Enterprise operators](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/search-api#building-search-queries)
* [X API v2 operators](/x-api/posts/search/integrate/build-a-query)



Now that we understand these different operator levels within X API v2, here is the table that maps out operator availability for Post counts (note that if the cell is left blank, the operator is not available):
