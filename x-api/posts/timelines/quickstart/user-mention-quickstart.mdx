## Getting started with the user Post and mention timeline endpoints

This quick start guide will help you make your first request to the user Post timeline endpoint with a set of specified fields using [Postman](/tutorials/postman-getting-started).

If you would like to see sample code in different languages, please visit our [X API v2 sample code](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code) GitHub repository. 
<Note>
**Prerequisites**

To complete this guide, you will need to have a set of [keys and tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) to authenticate your request. You can generate these keys and tokens by following these steps:

* [Sign up for a developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/apply-for-access) and receive approval.
* Create a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) and an associated [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) in the developer portal.
* Navigate to your App's “Keys and tokens” page to generate the required credentials. Make sure to save all credentials in a secure location.
</Note>
**Steps to build a timelines request**

_For this example, we will make a request to the user Post timeline by ID endpoint, but you can apply the learnings from this quick start to user mention timelines requests as well. _

**Step one: Start with a tool or library**

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we are going to use the Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load X API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:



<Button href="https://t.co/twitter-api-postman">
  Add X API v2 to Postman
</Button>

Once you have the X API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the timeline folder and find the "User Post timeline by ID" request.
 

**Step two: Authenticate your request**

To properly make a request to the X API, you need to verify that you have permission. To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with either [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#app-only-authentication-and-oauth-2-0-bearer-token), [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2), or [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) authentication methods.

For simplicity's sake, we will utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only with this request, but you will need to use one of the other authentication methods if you'd like to request private [metrics](/x-api/fundamentals/metrics) or Posts. 

You must add your keys and tokens, specifically the [App Access Token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#using-and-generating-an-app-only-bearer-token) (also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named “X API v2” in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the "initial value" and "current value" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).

This variable will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.
 

**Step three: Identify and specify which user from which you would like to retrieve Posts**

You must specify a user you would like to retrieve recent Posts for within the request. In this example, we will be passing a single user ID.

User IDs are simply the numerical value that represents an account handle that you can find within an account's profile URL. For example, the following account’s username is `XDevelopers`.

`https://x.com/XDevelopers`

To convert this username to the user ID, you will have to use the [users lookup endpoint](/x-api/users/lookup/introduction) with the username and find the numerical user ID in the payload. In the case of @XDevelopers, the user ID is 2244994945.

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and enter this user ID into the "Value" column of the id parameter.

|     |     |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Key** | **Value** |
| `id` | 2244994945 |

**Step four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve**

If you click the "Send" button after step three, you will receive the default [Post object](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary#tweet) fields in your response: id and text.

If you would like to receive additional fields beyond id and text, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](/x-api/fundamentals/fields) and/or [expansion](/x-api/fundamentals/expansions) parameters.

For this exercise, we will request a three additional different sets of fields from different objects:

1.  The additional tweet.created_at field in the primary user objects.

2.  The associated authors’ user object’s default fields for the returned Posts: id, name, and username
3.  The additional  user.created_at field in the associated user objects.
     

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and add the following key:value pair to the "Query Params" table:

|     |     |     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |
| `tweet.fields` | `created_at` | `tweets.created_at` |
| `expansions` | `author_id` | `includes.users.id`, `includes.users.name`, `includes.users.username` |
| `user.fields` | `created_at` | `includes.users.created_at` |
| max_results | 5   |     |


You should now see the following URL next to the "Send" button:

      `https://api.x.com/2/users/:id/tweets?tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at&max_results=5`

<Info>
**Please note:**

In Postman, the path parameter :id in the URL field will **not** automatically update to the value that you enter into the `id` params field, which is why the above URL includes `:id` and not 2244994945.

</Info>
**Step five: Make your request and review your response**

Once you have everything set up, hit the "Send" button and you will receive the following response:

```{
    "data": [

    ],
    "includes": {
        "users": [
            {
                "created_at": "2013-12-14T04:35:55.000Z",
                "id": "2244994945",
                "name": "Twitter Dev",
                "username": "TwitterDev"
            }
        ]
    },
    "meta": {
        "newest_id": "1301573587187331074",
        "next_token": "t3buvdr5pujq9g7bggsnf3ep2ha28",
        "oldest_id": "1296887316556980230",
        "previous_token": "t3equkmcd2zffvags2nkj0nhlrn78",
        "result_count": 5
    }
}
```


**Step six: Paginate through your results**

In the previous response, you will find a meta data object at the bottom that includes the following fields:

* oldest_id
* newest_id
* results_count
* next_token
* previous_token

In step four, we passed a max_results value of 5, meaning that each page will only include up to five results. To access the additional pages of data, we will be taking the value of the next_token field from our last results and adding that string as the value of the pagination_token parameter on the Postman params page, keeping everything else constant. 

|     |     |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Key** | **Value** |
| `pagination_token` | t3buvdr5pujq9g7bggsnf3ep2ha28 |

Once this is all set up, you can click "Send" again and you should receive the next page of results. 

We have put together a guide on [pagination](/x-api/fundamentals/pagination) to further explain this concept.
