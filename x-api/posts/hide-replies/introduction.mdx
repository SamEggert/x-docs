This endpoint gives you the ability to programmatically hide or unhide replies using criteria you define. Just like the functionality in the main X experience, replies will be hidden from the main conversation but still visible on a separate page. You can use the endpoint to create apps to help people hide replies they don’t find valuable.

The hide replies endpoint uses either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-1-0a-2) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2) authentication. If successful, the endpoint hides a single Reply that was published in a Post conversation that was initiated by an authenticated user. Each conversation supports hiding up to 725 Posts.
<Note>
**Account setup**
