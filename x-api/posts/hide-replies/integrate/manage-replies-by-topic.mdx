### Manage replies by topic

Through the hide replies endpoint, you can build integrations to help people and brands keep their conversation on topic. This page shows how to manage a conversation using the hide replies and [recent search](/x-api/posts/recent-search) endpoints.

Recent search has functionality to a conversation and its replies, and the Post payload returns [Post annotations](/x-api/fundamentals/post-annotations) to help you understand the context and topic of each Post, regardless of language.

The app's flow will have controls to display and manage a conversation:

1.  It asks the user’s permission to read their Posts and manage their replies.
2.  It pulls a recent conversation from a Post URL, and checks that the conversation is from the authenticating user.
3.  It will call the recent search endpoint to display each Post in the conversation. The request will include a conversation ID search query and the annotation expansion to determine if the Post is sports-related or not, according to X's interpretation of the Post.
4.  It calls Hide replies to hide a reply when the user chooses to do so. It will also provide a way to undo this action in case, so that the user is always in control. 

5.  For longer conversations, it will provide controls to [paginate through search results](/x-api/posts/search/integrate/paginate).
     

#### Optimize for the user (and for usage)

You can design a flow in a way that puts the user in control of any action they intend to make. Keeping this principle in mind also helps you build an integration that can optimize for Post consumption.

1.  Because the authenticated user can only manage conversations they started, your flow should terminate early when that's not the case.
    * Make an initial Post lookup request. Terminate the flow early if the Post URL is not valid or the conversation was not started by the authenticating user.
    * This way, your app doesn't have to make a recent search request if the conversation cannot be moderated by the authenticated user.
2.  Request [user and Post fields](/x-api/fundamentals/fields) in the same request to avoid making separate requests. This approach can also improve your app's performance.
3.  Avoid making requests when needed. This app caches a reply's hidden status in the user's browser. This is useful for larger conversations, where the user may want to pick up their moderation efforts at a later stage, and it helps your app optimize requests to hide or unhide replies.
