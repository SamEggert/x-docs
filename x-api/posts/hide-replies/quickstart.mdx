## Getting started with the hide replies endpoint

This quick start guide will help you make your first request to the hide replies endpoint using [Postman](/tutorials/postman-getting-started).

If you would like to see some code snippets in different languages, please visit the [hide replies API Reference page](/x-api/posts/hide-replies#put-2-tweets-id-hidden). 
<Note>
### Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need to have a set of [keys and tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) to authenticate your request. You can generate these keys and tokens by following these steps:

* [Sign up for a developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/apply-for-access) and receive approval.
* Create a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) and an associated [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) in the developer portal.
* Navigate to your App's “Keys and tokens” page to generate the required credentials. Make sure to save all credentials in a secure location.

### Steps to build a PUT /tweets/:id/hidden request

#### Step one: Start with a tool or library

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we are going to use the Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load X API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:

<Button href="https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/9956214-784efcda-ed4c-4491-a4c0-a26470a67400">
  Add X API v2 to Postman
</Button>
Once you have the X API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the hide replies endpoint.

#### Step two: Authenticate your request

To properly make a request to the X API, you need to verify that you have permission. To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request using either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2).

In this example, we are going to use OAuth 1.0a User Context.

You must add your keys and tokens – specifically your API Key, API Secret Key, OAuth 1.0a user Access Token, and OAuth 1.0a user Access Token Secret – to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named “X API v2” in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the "initial value" and "current value" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).

These variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.
 

#### Step three: Find a Post ID to hide

The hide replies endpoint can hide or unhide replies on behalf of an authorized user. Because we are using the Access Tokens related to your user profile in this example, you will be able to hide replies from users who participate in a conversation started by you. Similarly, if you were using Access Tokens that belong to another user that authorized your app, you would be able to moderate replies to any conversations started by that account.

Ask a friend to reply to a Post (let them know you're testing hide replies) or reply to any of your Posts from a test account. Click on that reply, then copy the numeric part of its URL. That will be the Post ID we will hide.

In this case, we will be looking at the following Post, which has the ID `1232720193182412800`:

`https://x.com/TwitterDev/status/1232720193182412800`

#### Step four: Hide the Post

In Postman, open the Hide replies folder and select Hide a reply. In the Params tab, paste the Post ID next to the id field (you won't need to replace :id in the URL). Click "Send" and you will see a successful response.

      `{"hidden":true}`


#### Step five: Unhide the Post

Hidden Posts are moved to a separate tab in the X app. To unhide a Post in Postman, open the Hide replies folder and select Unhide a reply. In the Params tab, paste the same Post ID used in the previous step next into the id field. Click "Send" and you will see a successful response.

      `{"hidden":false}`



The hidden field represents the hidden status of the Post. A hidden status of true means the Post is hidden. Similarly, false means the Post is not hidden.
