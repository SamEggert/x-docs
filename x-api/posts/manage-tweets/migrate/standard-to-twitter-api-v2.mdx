## Standard v1.1 compared to X API v2

If you have been working with the standard v1.1 [POST statuses/update](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-update) and [POST statuses/destroy/:id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-destroy-id) endpoints, the goal of this guide is to help you understand the similarities and differences between the standard and X API v2 manage Posts endpoints.

### Similarities

**Authentication**

Both the standard v1.1 and X API v2 manage Posts ([POST statuses/update](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-update) and [POST statuses/destroy/:id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-destroy-id)) endpoints use [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/resources/fundamentals/authentication). Therefore, if you were previously using one of the standard v1.1 endpoints, you can continue using the same authentication method if you migrate to the X API v2 version.Â 

### Differences

**Endpoint URLs**

* Standard v1.1 endpoints:
    * https://api.x.com/1.1/statuses/update.json
        (Creates a Post)
    * `https://api.x.com/1.1/statuses/destroy/:id.json`
        (Deletes a Post)
* X API v2 endpoint:
    * https://api.x.com/2/tweets
        (Creates a Post)
    * https://api.x.com/2/tweets/:id
        (Deletes a specified Post)

### App and Project requirements

The X API v2 endpoints require that you use credentials from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is associated with a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) when authenticating your requests. All X API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a project.

### Request parameters

The following standard v1.1 request parameters accepted two request query parameters (user_id or screen_name). The X API v2 only accepts the numerical Post ID for the DELETE endpoint, and it must be passed as part of the endpoint path.

For the POST endpoint, additional parameters will need to be passed in via the JSON body of the request. You can learn more about what parameters are available in the [API reference guide](/x-api/posts/manage-tweets/introduction).
