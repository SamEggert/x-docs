### Getting started with the manage Likes endpoints

This quick start guide will help you make your first request to the manage Likes endpoints using [Postman](/tutorials/postman-getting-started).

If you would like to see sample code in different languages, please visit our [X API v2 sample code](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code) GitHub repository. 


#### Prerequisites

For you to be able to complete this guide, you will have need to have a set of [keys and tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication), which you can generate by following these steps:

1.  [Apply for a developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/apply-for-access) and receive approval.
2.  Create a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) and an associated [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) in the developer portal.

3.  Navigate to your app's “Keys and tokens” page, and save your API Keys, Access Tokens, and Bearer Token to your password manager.


#### Steps to build a manage Likes request

**Step one: Start with a tool or library**

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we are going to use the Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load the X API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:

Once you have the X API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the “Likes” folder, and select “Like a Post”.

**Step two: Authenticate your request**

To make a successful request to this endpoint, you will need to use [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication). To do this, you must add the following keys and tokens to Postman by selecting the environment named “X API v2”, and adding the following variables to the initial value and current value fields:

* consumer_key with your API Key
* consumer_secret with your API Key Secret
* access_token with your Access Token
* token_secret with your Access Token Secret
     

**Step three: Specify which Post you are going to like**

Manage Likes endpoints require two IDs: one for the user (the user who wishes to like a Post), and the other representing the  Post ID that the user is trying to like or unlike. 

The user’s ID must correspond to the authenticating user’s ID, meaning that you must pass the [Access Tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow) associated with the user ID when authenticating your request.  In this case, you can specify the ID belonging to your own user. You can find your ID in two ways:

1.  Using the [user lookup by username](/x-api/users/user-lookup-by-id) endpoint, you can pass a username and receive the id field. 
2.  Looking at your Access Token, you will find that the numeric part is your user ID.
     

You also must specify a Post that you want to like. You can find the Post ID by navigating to x.com and clicking on a Post and then looking in the URL. For example, the following URL's Post ID is 1228393702244134912.

https://x.com/TwitterDev/status/1228393702244134912

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab, and enter your ID into the "Value" column of the id path variable. Navigate to the “Body” tab and ID of the Post you wish to like as the value for the tweet_id parameter. Be sure not to include any spaces before or after any ID.

|     |     |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Key** | **Value** |
| `id` | (your user ID) |
| tweet_id | (the ID of the Post you want to like) |


If you click the "Send" button, you will receive a response object containing the status of the relationship:

* If you receive a "liked": true, then the id is successfully liking the tweet_id.
     

**Step four: Make your request and review your response**

Once you have everything set up, hit the "Send" button and you will receive the following response:

```
{
    "data": {
        "liked": true
    }
}
```

If you wish to unlike the same Post you can use the request entitled “Unlike a Post”, which is also found in the “Likes” folder of the X API v2 collection in Postman. The id and tweet_id should be used in the same way as the previous example.  To unlike a Post, you will not have to add this as a JSON body so you will want to make sure that you add in the requisite query params for id and tweet_id.
