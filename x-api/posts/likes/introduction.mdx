### Likes lookup

With endpoints in the Likes lookup group, you can retrieve a list of accounts that have liked a Post, or a list of Posts that an account has liked. These endpoints include:

* Posts liked by a user - GET /2/users/:id/liked_tweets
* Users who have liked a Post - GET /2/tweets/:id/liking_users

You can authenticate these endpoints with either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0). For the liked Posts endpoints, pagination tokens will be provided for paging through large sets of results.

The liking users endpoint limits you to a total of 100 liking accounts per post for all time.  Additionally, the liked Posts endpoint is also subject to the monthly [Post cap](/x-api/fundamentals/post-cap) applied at the Project level.
 

### Manage Likes

The manage Likes endpoints enable you to like or unlike a specified Post on behalf of an authenticated account. For this endpoint group, there are two methods available POST and DELETE. The POST method allows you to like a Post, and the DELETE method will enable you to unlike a Post.

Since you are making requests on behalf of a user, you must authenticate these endpoints with [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) and use the Access Tokens associated with the user, which can be generated using the [3-legged OAuth flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-1-0a-2)/obtaining-user-access-tokens). You can like a Post from your account or an account of an authenticated user. With both endpoints, there is a user rate limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes per endpoint. 
 

To access these endpoint, you must have an approved [developer account](/resources/fundamentals/developer-portal). When authenticating, you must use keys and tokens from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is located within a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects).
