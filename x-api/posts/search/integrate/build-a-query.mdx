## Building queries for Search Posts

The search endpoints accept a single query with a GET request and return a set of historical Posts that match the query.  Queries are made up of operators that are used to match on a variety of Post attributes.

### Building a query

#### Query limitations

Your queries will be limited depending on which [access level](/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api) you are using. 

If you have Basic or Pro access, your query can be 512 characters long for recent search endpoint. 

If you have Pro access, your query can be 1,024 characters long for full archive search endpoint. 

#### Operator availability

While most operators are available to any developer, there are several that are reserved for certain access levels. We list which access level each operator is available to in the [list of operators](/x-api/posts/search/integrate/build-a-query) table using the following labels:

* **Core operators:** Available when using any [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects).
* **Advanced operators:** Available when using a Project with certain access level

#### Operator types: standalone and conjunction-required

**Standalone operators** can be used alone or together with any other operators (including those that require conjunction).

For example, the following query will work because it uses the `#hashtag` operator, which is standalone:

`#xapiv2`

**Conjunction-required** operators cannot be used by themselves in a query; they can only be used when at least one standalone operator is included in the query. This is because using these operators alone would be far too general, and would match on an extremely high volume of Posts.

For example, the following queries are not supported since they contain only conjunction-required operators:

`has:media`

`has:links OR is:retweet`

If we add in a standalone operator, such as the phrase `"X data"`, the query would then work properly. 

`"X data" has:mentions (has:media OR has:links)`

#### Boolean operators and grouping

If you would like to string together multiple operators in a single query, you have the following tools at your disposal:

|     |     |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AND logic** | Successive operators with a space between them will result in boolean "AND" logic, meaning that Posts will match only if both conditions are met. For example, `snow day #NoSchool` will match Posts containing the terms snow and day and the hashtag #NoSchool. |
| **OR logic** | Successive operators with OR between them will result in OR logic, meaning that Posts will match if either condition is met. For example, specifying `grumpy OR cat OR #meme` will match any Posts containing at least the terms grumpy or cat, or the hashtag #meme. |
| **NOT logic, negation** | Prepend a dash (-) to a keyword (or any operator) to negate it (NOT). For example, `cat #meme -grumpy` will match Posts containing the hashtag #meme and the term cat, but only if they do not contain the term grumpy. One common query clause is `-is:retweet`, which will not match on Retweets, thus matching only on original Posts, Quote Tweets, and replies. All operators can be negated, but negated operators cannot be used alone. |
| **Grouping** | You can use parentheses to group operators together. For example, `(grumpy cat) OR (#meme has:images)` will return either Posts containing the terms grumpy and cat, or Posts with images containing the hashtag #meme. Note that ANDs are applied first, then ORs are applied. |

**A note on negations**

The operators `-is:nullcast` must always be negated.

Negated operators cannot be used alone.

Do not negate a set of operators grouped together in a set of parentheses. Instead, negate each individual operator. For example, instead of using `skiing -(snow OR day OR noschool)`, we suggest that you use `skiing -snow -day -noschool`. 

#### Order of operations

When combining AND and OR functionality, the following order of operations will dictate how your query is evaluated.

1.  Operators connected by AND logic are combined first
2.  Then, operators connected with OR logic are applied



For example:

* `apple OR iphone ipad` would be evaluated as `apple OR (iphone ipad)`
* `ipad iphone OR android` would be evaluated as `(iphone ipad) OR android`

To eliminate uncertainty and ensure that your query is evaluated as intended, group terms together with parentheses where appropriate. 

For example:

* `(apple OR iphone) ipad`
* `iphone (ipad OR android)`

#### Punctuation, diacritics, and case sensitivity

If you specify a keyword or hashtag query with character accents or diacritics, it will match Post text that contains both the term with the accents and diacritics, as well as those terms with normal characters. For example, queries with a keyword `Diacrítica` or hashtag `#cumpleaños` will match _Diacrítica_ or _#cumpleaños_, as well as with _Diacritica_ or _#cumpleanos_ without the tilde í or eñe.

Characters with accents or diacritics are treated the same as normal characters and are not treated as word boundaries. For example, a query with the keyword `cumpleaños` would only match activities containing the word _cumpleaños_ and would not match activities containing _cumplea_, _cumplean_, or _os_.

All operators are evaluated in a case-insensitive manner. For example, the query `cat` will match Posts with all of the following: _cat_, _CAT_, _Cat_.

The [filtered stream](/x-api/posts/filtered-stream) matching behavior acts differently from Search Posts. When [building a filtered stream rule](/x-api/posts/filtered-stream#building-rules-for-filtered-stream), know that keywords and hashtags that include accents and diacritics will only match on terms that also include the accent and diacritic, and will not match on terms that use normal characters instead. 

For example, filtered stream rules that include a keyword `Diacrítica` or hashtag `#cumpleaños` will only match the terms _Diacrítica_ and _#cumpleaños_, and will not match on _Diacritica_ or _#cumpleanos_ without the tilde í or eñe

#### Specificity and efficiency

When you start to build your query, it is important to keep a few things in mind.

* Using broad, standalone operators for your query such as a single keyword or #hashtag is generally not recommended since it will likely match on a massive volume of Posts. Creating a more robust query will result in a more specific set of matching Posts, and will hopefully reduce the amount of noise in the payload that you will need to sift through to find valuable insights. 
    * For example, if your query was just the keyword `happy` you will likely get anywhere from 200,000 - 300,000 Posts per day.
    * Adding more conditional operators narrows your search results, for example `(happy OR happiness) place_country:GB -birthday -is:retweet`
* Writing efficient queries is also beneficial for staying within the characters query length restriction. The character count includes the entire query string including spaces and operators.
    * For example, the following query is 59 characters long: `(happy OR happiness) place_country:GB -birthday -is:retweet`

#### Quote Tweet matching behavior

When using the Search Posts endpoints, operators will not match on the content from the original Post that was quoted, but will match on the content included in the Quote Tweet.

However, please note that [filtered stream](/x-api/posts/filtered-stream) will match on both the content from the original P that was quoted and the Quote Tweet's content.

#### Iteratively building a query

##### Test your query early and often

Getting a query to return the "right" results the first time is rare. There is so much on X that may or may not be obvious at first and the query syntax described above may be hard to match to your desired search. As you build a query, it is important for you to periodically test it out.

For this section, we are going to start with the following query and adjust it based on the results that we receive during our test: 

`happy OR happiness`

##### Use results to narrow the query

As you test the query, you should scan the returned Posts to see if they include the data that you are expecting and hoping to receive. Starting with a broad query and a superset of Post matches allows you to review the result and narrow the query to filter out undesired results.  

When we tested the example query, we noticed that we were getting Po in a variety of different languages. In this situation, we want to only receive Posts that are in english, so we’re going to add the `lang:` operator:

`(happy OR happiness) lang:en`

The test delivered a number of Posts wishing people a happy birthday, so we are going to add `-birthday` as a negated keyword operator. We also want to only receive original Posts, so we’ve added the negated `-is:retweet` operator:

`(happy OR happiness) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet`

##### Adjust for inclusion where needed

If you notice that you are not receiving data that you expect and know that there are existing Posts that should return, you may need to broaden your query by removing operators that may be filtering out the desired data. 

For our example, we noticed that there were other Posts in our personal timeline that expressed the emotion that we are looking for and weren’t included in the test results. To ensure we have greater coverage, we are going to add the keywords, `excited` and `elated`.

`(happy OR happiness OR excited OR elated) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet`

##### Adjust for popular trends/bursts over the time period

Trends come and go on X quickly. Maintaining your query should be an active process. If you plan to use a query for a while, we suggest that you periodically check in on the data that you are receiving to see if you need to make any adjustments.

In our example, we notice that we started to receive some Posts that are wishing people a “happy holidays”. Since we don’t want these Posts included in our results, we are going to add a negated `-holidays` keyword.

`(happy OR happiness OR excited OR elated) lang:en -birthday -is:retweet -holidays`

### Adding a query to your request

To add your query to your request, you must use the `query` parameter. As with any query parameters, you must make sure to HTTP encode the query that you developed.

Here is an example of what this might look like using a cURL command, with an additional `tweet.fields` and `max_results` parameter included. If you would like to use this command, please make sure to replace `$BEARER_TOKEN` with your own [Bearer Token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0):

```bash
curl https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=cat%20has%3Amedia%20-grumpy&tweet.fields=created_at&max_results=100 -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN"
```

### Query examples

#### Tracking a natural disaster

The following query matched on original Posts coming from weather agencies and gauges that discuss Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston in 2017.

Here is what the query would look like without the HTTP encoding:

`has:geo (from:NWSNHC OR from:NHC\_Atlantic OR from:NWSHouston OR from:NWSSanAntonio OR from:USGS\_TexasRain OR from:USGS_TexasFlood OR from:JeffLindner1) -is:retweet`

And here is what the query would look like with the HTTP encoding, the query parameter, and the recent search URI:

`https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=-is%3Aretweet%20has%3Ageo%20(from%3ANWSNHC%20OR%20from%3ANHC\_Atlantic%20OR%20from%3ANWSHouston%20OR%20from%3ANWSSanAntonio%20OR%20from%3AUSGS\_TexasRain%20OR%20from%3AUSGS_TexasFlood%20OR%20from%3AJeffLindner1)`

#### Reviewing the sentiment of a conversation

The next rule could be used to better understand the sentiment of the conversation developing around the hashtag, _#nowplaying_, but scoped to just Posts published within North America.

Here is what the two different queries, one for positive and one for negative, would look like without the HTTP encoding:

`#nowplaying (happy OR exciting OR excited OR favorite OR fav OR amazing OR lovely OR incredible) (place\_country:US OR place\_country:MX OR place_country:CA) -horrible -worst -sucks -bad -disappointing`

`#nowplaying (horrible OR worst OR sucks OR bad OR disappointing) (place\_country:US OR place\_country:MX OR place_country:CA) -happy -exciting -excited -favorite -fav -amazing -lovely -incredible`

And here is what the query would look like with the HTTP encoding, the query parameter, and the recent search URI:

`https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=%23nowplaying%20(happy%20OR%20exciting%20OR%20excited%20OR%20favorite%20OR%20fav%20OR%20amazing%20OR%20lovely%20OR%20incredible)%20(place\_country%3AUS%20OR%20place\_country%3AMX%20OR%20place_country%3ACA)%20-horrible%20-worst%20-sucks%20-bad%20-disappointing`

`https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=%23nowplaying%20(horrible%20OR%20worst%20OR%20sucks%20OR%20bad%20OR%20disappointing)%20(place\_country%3AUS%20OR%20place\_country%3AMX%20OR%20place_country%3ACA)%20-happy%20-exciting%20-excited%20-favorite%20-fav%20-amazing%20-lovely%20-incredible`

#### Find Posts that relate to a specific Post annotation

This rule was built to search for original Posts that included an image of a pet that is not a cat, where the language identified in the Post is Japanese. To do this, we used the `context:` operator to take advantage of the [Post annotation](/x-api/fundamentals/post-annotations) functionality. We first used the [Post lookup](/x-api/posts/lookup/introduction) endpoint and the `tweet.fields=context_annotations` fields parameter to identify which domain.entity IDs we need to use in our query:

* Posts that relate to cats return `domain` 66 (Interests and Hobbies category) with entity 852262932607926273 (Cats). 
* Posts that relate to pets return `domain` 65 (Interests and Hobbies Vertical) with entity 852262932607926273 (Pets). 

Here is what the query would look like without the HTTP encoding:

`context:65.852262932607926273 -context:66.852262932607926273 -is:retweet has:images lang:ja`

And here is what the query would look like with the HTTP encoding, the query parameter, and the recent search URI:

`https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=context%3A65.852262932607926273%20-context%3A66.852262932607926273%20-is%3Aretweet%20has%3Aimages%20lang%3Aja`

### Operators

<Note>**Note:** For some operators, an alternate name, or alias, is available.</Note>

| **Operator** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------------|
| `keyword` | Standalone | Matches a keyword within the body of a Post. This is a tokenized match, meaning that your keyword string will be matched against the tokenized text of the Post body. Tokenization splits words based on punctuation, symbols, and Unicode basic plane separator characters.<br/><br/>For example, a Post with the text “I like coca-cola” would be split into the following tokens: I, like, coca, cola. These tokens would then be compared to the keyword string used in your query. To match strings containing punctuation (for example coca-cola), symbol, or separator characters, you must wrap your keyword in double-quotes.<br/><br/>Example: `pepsi OR cola OR "coca cola"` |
| `emoji` | Standalone | Matches an emoji within the body of a Post. Similar to a keyword, emojis are a tokenized match, meaning that your emoji will be matched against the tokenized text of the Post body.<br/><br/>Note that if an emoji has a variant, you must wrap it in double quotes to add to a query.<br/><br/>Example: `(😃 OR 😡) 😬` |
| `"exact phrase match"` | Standalone | Matches the exact phrase within the body of a Post.<br/><br/>Example: `("X API" OR #v2) -"recent search"` |
| `#` | Standalone | Matches any Post containing a recognized hashtag, if the hashtag is a recognized entity in a Post.<br/><br/>This operator performs an exact match, NOT a tokenized match, meaning the rule `#thanku` will match posts with the exact hashtag #thanku, but not those with the hashtag #thankunext.<br/><br/>Example: `#thankunext #fanart OR @arianagrande` |
| `@` | Standalone | Matches any Post that mentions the given username, if the username is a recognized entity (including the @ character).<br/><br/>Example: `(@XDevelopers OR @API) -@X` |
| `$` | Standalone | Matches any Post that contains the specified 'cashtag' (where the leading character of the token is the &dollar; character).<br/><br/>Note that the cashtag operator relies on X's 'symbols' entity extraction to match cashtags, rather than trying to extract the cashtag from the body itself.<br/><br/>Example: `$twtr OR @XDevelopers -$fb` |
| `from:` | Standalone | Matches any Post from a specific user.<br/>The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user’s numeric user ID.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single username/ID per `from:` operator.<br/><br/>Example: `from:XDevelopers OR from:API -from:X` |
| `to:` | Standalone | Matches any Post that is in reply to a particular user.<br/>The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user’s numeric user ID.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single username/ID per `to:` operator.<br/><br/>Example: `to:XDevelopers OR to:API -to:X` |
| `url:` | Standalone | Performs a tokenized match on any validly-formatted URL of a Post.<br/><br/>This operator matches on the contents of both the `url` or `expanded_url` fields. For example, a Post containing "You should check out X Developer Labs: https://t.co/c0A36SWil4" (with the short URL redirecting to https://developer.twitter.com) will match both the following rules:<br/><br/>`from:XDevelopers url:"https://developer.twitter.com"` (because it will match the contents of `entities.urls.expanded_url`)<br/><br/>`from:XDevelopers url:"https://t.co"` (because it will match the contents of `entities.urls.url`)<br/><br/>Tokens and phrases containing punctuation or special characters should be double-quoted (for example, `url:"/developer"`). Similarly, to match on a specific protocol, enclose in double-quotes (for example, `url:"https://developer.twitter.com"`). |
| `retweets_of:` | Standalone | Matches Posts that are Retweets of the specified user. The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user’s numeric user ID.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single username/ID per `retweets_of:` operator.<br/><br/>Example: `retweets_of:twitterdev OR retweets_of:twitterapi` |
| `in_reply_to_tweet_id:` | Standalone | *Available alias:* `in_reply_to_status_id:`<br/>Matches on replies to the specified Post.<br/><br/>Example: `in_reply_to_tweet_id:1539382664746020864` |
| `retweets_of_tweet_id:` | Standalone | *Available alias:* `retweets_of_status_id:`<br/>Matches on explicit (or native) Retweets of the specified Post. Note that the Post ID used should be the ID of an original Post and not a Retweet.<br/><br/>Example: `retweets_of_tweet_id:1539382664746020864` |
| `quotes_of_tweet_id:` | Standalone | *Available alias:* `quotes_of_status_id:`<br/>Matches on Quote Tweets of the specified Post. Note that the Post ID used should be the ID of an original Post and not a Quote Tweet.<br/><br/>Example: `quotes_of_tweet_id:1539382664746020864` |
| `context:` | Standalone | Matches Posts with a specific domain id/entity id pair. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on [annotations](/x-api/fundamentals/post-annotations).<br/><br/>You can only pass a single domain/entity per `context:` operator.<br/><br/>`context:domain_id.entity_id`<br/><br/>However, you can combine multiple domain/entities using the OR operator:<br/><br/>`(context:47.1139229372198469633 OR context:11.1088514520308342784)`<br/><br/>Examples:<br/>`context:10.799022225751871488` (`domain_id.entity_id` returns Posts matching that specific domain-entity pair) |
| `entity:` | Standalone | Matches Posts with a specific entity string value. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on [annotations](/x-api/fundamentals/post-annotations).<br/>**Please note** that this is only available with recent search.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single `entity:` operator.<br/><br/>`entity:"string declaration of entity/place"`<br/><br/>Examples: `entity:"Michael Jordan" OR entity:"Barcelona"` |
| `conversation_id:` | Standalone | Matches Posts that share a common conversation ID. A conversation ID is set to the Post ID of a Post that started a conversation. As Replies to a Post are posted, even Replies to Replies, the `conversation_id` is added to its JSON payload.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single conversation ID per `conversation_id:` operator.<br/><br/>Example: `conversation_id:1334987486343299072 (from:XDevelopers OR from:api)` |
| `list:` | Standalone | **NEW** Matches Posts posted by users who are members of a specified list.<br/><br/>For example, if @XDevelopers and @api were members of List 123, and you included `list:123` in your query, your response will only contain Posts that have been published by those accounts. You can find List IDs by using the [List lookup](/x-api/lists/list-lookup/introduction) endpoint.<br/><br/>**Please note** that you can only use a single `list:` operator per query, and you can only specify a single List per `list:` operator.<br/><br/>Example: `list:123` |
| `place:` | Standalone | Matches Posts tagged with the specified location or X place ID. Multi-word place names (“New York City”, “Palo Alto”) should be enclosed in quotes.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single place per `place:` operator.<br/><br/>Note: See the [GET geo/search](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-search) standard v1.1 endpoint for how to obtain X place IDs.<br/><br/>Note: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Post. It will also not match on places attached to the original Post of a Quote Tweet.<br/><br/>Example: `place:"new york city" OR place:seattle OR place:fd70c22040963ac7` |
| `place_country:` | Standalone | Matches Posts where the country code associated with a tagged place/location matches the given ISO alpha-2 character code.<br/><br/>You can find a list of valid ISO codes on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).<br/><br/>You can only pass a single ISO code per `place_country:` operator.<br/><br/>Note: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Post. It will also not match on places attached to the original Post of a Quote Tweet.<br/><br/>Example: `place_country:US OR place_country:MX OR place_country:CA` |
| `point_radius:` | Standalone | Matches against the `place.geo.coordinates` object of the Post when present, and in X, against a place geo polygon, where the Place polygon is fully contained within the defined region.<br/><br/>`point_radius:[longitude latitude radius]`<br/><br/>- Units of radius supported are miles (mi) and kilometers (km)<br/>- Radius must be less than 25mi<br/>- Longitude is in the range of ±180<br/>- Latitude is in the range of ±90<br/>- All coordinates are in decimal degrees<br/>- Rule arguments are contained within brackets, space delimited<br/><br/>You can only pass a single geo polygon per `point_radius:` operator.<br/><br/>Note: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Post. It will also not match on places attached to the original Post of a Quote Tweet.<br/><br/>Example: `point_radius:[2.355128 48.861118 16km] OR point_radius:[-41.287336 174.761070 20mi]` |
| `bounding_box:` | Standalone | *Available alias:* `geo_bounding_box:`<br/>Matches against the place.geo.coordinates object of the Post when present, and in X, against a place geo polygon, where the place polygon is fully contained within the defined region.<br/><br/>`bounding_box:[west_long south_lat east_long north_lat]`<br/><br/>- `west_long south_lat` represent the southwest corner of the bounding box where `west_long` is the longitude of that point, and `south_lat` is the latitude.<br/>- `east_long north_lat` represent the northeast corner of the bounding box, where `east_long` is the longitude of that point, and `north_lat` is the latitude.<br/>- Width and height of the bounding box must be less than 25mi<br/>- Longitude is in the range of ±180<br/>- Latitude is in the range of ±90<br/>- All coordinates are in decimal degrees.<br/>- Rule arguments are contained within brackets, space delimited.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single geo polygons per `bounding_box:` operator.<br/><br/>Note: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Post. It will also not match on places attached to the original Post of a Quote Tweet.<br/><br/>Example: `bounding_box:[-105.301758 39.964069 -105.178505 40.09455]` |
| `is:retweet` | Conjunction required | Matches on Retweets that match the rest of the specified rule. This operator looks only for true Retweets (for example, those generated using the Retweet button). Quote Tweets will not be matched by this operator.<br/><br/>Example: `data @XDevelopers -is:retweet` |
| `is:reply` | Conjunction required | Deliver only explicit replies that match a rule. Can also be negated to exclude replies that match a query from delivery.<br/><br/>Note: This operator is also available with the filtered stream endpoint. When used with filtered stream, this operator matches on replies to an original Post, replies in quoted Tweets, and replies in Retweets.<br/><br/>Example: `from:XDevelopers is:reply` |
| `is:quote` | Conjunction required | Returns all Quote Tweets, also known as Posts with comments.<br/><br/>Example: `"sentiment analysis" is:quote` |
| `is:verified` | Conjunction required | Deliver only Posts whose authors are verified by X.<br/><br/>Example: `#nowplaying is:verified` |
| `-is:nullcast` | Conjunction required | Removes Posts created for promotion only on ads.twitter.com that have a `"source":"Twitter for Advertisers (legacy)"` or `"source":"Twitter for Advertisers"`.<br/>This operator must be negated.<br/><br/>For more info on Nullcasted Posts, see our page on [Post availability](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/guides/tweet-availability).<br/><br/>Example: `"mobile games" -is:nullcast` |
| `has:hashtags` | Conjunction required | Matches Posts that contain at least one hashtag.<br/><br/>Example: `from:XDevelopers -has:hashtags` |
| `has:cashtags` | Conjunction required | Matches Posts that contain a cashtag symbol (with a leading ‘$’ character. For example, `$tag`).<br/><br/>Example: `#stonks has:cashtags` |
| `has:links` | Conjunction required | This operator matches Posts which contain links and media in the Post body.<br/><br/>Example: `from:XDevelopers announcement has:links` |
| `has:mentions` | Conjunction required | Matches Posts that mention another X user.<br/><br/>Example: `#nowplaying has:mentions` |
| `has:media` | Conjunction required | *Available alias:* `has:media_link`<br/>Matches Posts that contain a media object, such as a photo, GIF, or video, as determined by X. This will not match on media created with Periscope, or Posts with links to other media hosting sites.<br/><br/>Example: `(kittens OR puppies) has:media` |
| `has:images` | Conjunction required | Matches Posts that contain a recognized URL to an image.<br/><br/>Example: `#meme has:images` |
| `has:video_link` | Conjunction required | *Available alias:* `has:videos`<br/>Matches Posts that contain native X videos, uploaded directly to X. This will not match on videos created with Periscope, or Posts with links to other video hosting sites.<br/><br/>Example: `#icebucketchallenge has:video_link` |
| `has:geo` | Conjunction required | Matches Posts that have Post-specific geolocation data provided by the X user. This can be either a location in the form of a X place, with the corresponding display name, geo polygon, and other fields, or in rare cases, a geo lat-long coordinate.<br/><br/>Note: Operators matching on place (Post geo) will only include matches from original Posts.
