## Getting started with the recent search endpoint

This quick start guide will help you make your first request to the recent search endpoint with a set of specified fields using Postman.

If you would like to see sample code in different languages, please visit our¬†[X API v2 sample code](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code)¬†GitHub¬†repository.¬†

<Note>
### **Prerequisites**

To complete this guide, you will need to have a set of¬†[keys and tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication)¬†to authenticate your request. You can generate these keys and tokens by following these steps:

* [Sign up for a developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/apply-for-access)¬†and receive approval.
* Create a¬†[Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects)¬†and an associated¬†[developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps)¬†in the developer portal.
* Navigate to your App's ‚ÄúKeys and tokens‚Äù page to generate the required credentials. Make sure to save all credentials in a secure location.
</Note>

### Steps to build a recent search request

**Step one: Start with a tool or library**

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we are going to use the Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load X API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:

<Button href="https://t.co/twitter-api-postman">
  Add X API v2 to Postman
</Button>

Once you have the X API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the Search Posts > Recent search request.

**Step two: Authenticate your request**

To properly make a request to the X API, you need to verify that you have permission. To do this with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with either [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#app-only-authentication-and-oauth-2-0-bearer-token), [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2), or [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) authentication methods.

For simplicity's sake, we will utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only with this request, but you will need to use one of the other authentication methods if you'd like to request private [metrics](/x-api/fundamentals/metrics) or Posts.¬†

To utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only, you must add your keys and tokens, specifically the [App Access Token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#using-and-generating-an-app-only-bearer-token) (also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named ‚ÄúX API v2‚Äù in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the "initial value" and "current value" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).

These variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.
¬†

**Step three: Create a search query**

Each recent search query requires a single [search query](/x-api/posts/search/integrate/build-a-query). For this example, we are going to use a query that matches on Posts posted by the @XDevelopers account. For this query we use the from operator and set it to XDevelopers¬†(case insensitive):

`from:XDevelopers`

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and enter this ID, or a string of Post IDs separated by a comma, into the "Value" column of the `ids` parameter.

|     |     |     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key** | **Value** | **Description** |
| `query` | from:XDevelopers | Search query to submit to the recent search endpoint |

**Step four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve**

If you click the "Send" button after step three, you will receive the default [Post object](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary#tweet) fields in your response: id¬†,¬†text, and¬† `edit_history_tweet_ids`. If you would like to receive additional fields beyond id¬†,¬†text, and `edit_history_tweet_ids`, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](/x-api/fundamentals/fields) and/or [expansion](/x-api/fundamentals/expansions) parameters.

For this exercise, we will request a four different sets of fields from different objects:

1.  The default Post object fields.
2.  The additional tweet.created_at field in the primary user objects.
3.  The associated authors‚Äô user object‚Äôs default fields for the returned Posts.
4.  The additional¬† user.description¬†field in the associated user objects.

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and add the following key:value pair to the "Query Params" table:

|     |     |     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |
| `tweet.fields` | `created_at` | `tweets.created_at` |
| `expansions` | `author_id` | `includes.users.id`, `includes.users.name`, `includes.users.username` |
| `user.fields` | `description` | `includes.users.description` |

You should now see the following URL next to the "Send" button:

`https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=from:XDevelopers&tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at`


**Step five: Make your request and review your response**

Once you have everything set up, hit the "Send" button and you will receive the following response:
