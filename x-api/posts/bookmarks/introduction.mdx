### Manage Bookmarks

We have two available methods for manage Bookmarks, POST and DELETE. The POST method lets you create Bookmarks. Likewise, the DELETE method allows you to delete a specific Bookmark. 

There is a per-user rate limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes for the POST and DELETE methods.

Since you are making requests on behalf of a user with the manage Bookmarks endpoints, you must authenticate by generating a user Access Token with OAuth 2.0. You can use the [Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token) to do so. To use this endpoint you must pass in the scopes `tweet.read`, `users.read`, and  `bookmark.write`.

### Bookmarks lookup

The Bookmarks lookup endpoint has one method available, GET. This method allows you to get Bookmarks back from yourself or an authenticated account. Pagination tokens will be provided for paging through large sets of results for this endpoint.

There is a per-user rate limit of 180 requests per 15 min window for the GET method. With this endpoint you will get back 800 of your most recent Bookmarked Posts.

**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved [developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is located within a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects).
