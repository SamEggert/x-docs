### Getting started with the Bookmarks lookup endpoint

This quick start guide will help you make your first request to the Bookmarks lookup endpoint using [Postman](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tools-and-libraries/using-postman).

Please visit our [X API v2 sample code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code) GitHub repository if you want to see sample code in different languages.

#### Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need to have a set of [keys and tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) to authenticate your request. You can generate these keys and tokens by following these steps:

* [Sign up for a developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/apply-for-access) and receive approval.
* Create a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) and an associated [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) in the developer portal.
* Navigate to your App's “Keys and tokens” page to generate the required credentials. Make sure to save all credentials in a secure location.

#### Steps to build a Bookmarks lookup request

**Step one: Start with a tool or library**

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we will use the Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load the X API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:

<Button href="https://t.co/twitter-api-postman">
  Add X API v2 to Postman
</Button>
Once you have the X API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the “Bookmarks” folder, and select “ Bookmarks lookup”.

**Step two: Authenticate your request**

To make a successful request to this endpoint, you will need to use [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code). You can generate an access token within Postman. 

If you go to the tab entitled “Authorization” and select “OAuth 2.0”.

In this tab, be sure to follow these steps:

1.  Name your token

2.  Select the Grant Type as Authorization Code (with PKCE)

3.  Update the parameters:

    **Callback URL** - [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)

    This should be matching the callback URL you set in your auth settings page in the Developer Portal.

    **Auth URL** - [https://twitter.com/i/oauth2/authorize](https://twitter.com/i/oauth2/authorize)

    **Access Token URL** - [https://api.x.com/2/oauth2/token](https://api.twitter.com/2/oauth2/token)

    **Client ID** - Cut and paste OAuth 2.0 client ID from the Developer Portal

    **Client Secret** - Cut and paste OAuth 2.0 client ID from the Developer Portal. You will need this only if you are using an App type that is a confidential client.

4.  Update the scopes with the following values: post.read users.read bookmark.read

5.  Populate the field state with “State”

6.  Click where it says “Generate Token”

7.  Press the save icon to save the folder changes.


You may get a message that you are not logged into X. If you get this error, you will need to log in to the X account inside of Postman you are trying to post on behalf of.

**Step three: Specify a user**

With this endpoint, you must specify the user ID whose followers you would like to receive in the response. For example, the user ID for @XDevelopers is2244994945. In Postman, navigate to the “Params” tab and enter the ID of yourself or an authenticated user as the value for the id parameter.

|     |     |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Key** | **Value** |
| `id` | 2244994945 |

**Step four: Make your request and review your response**

Once you have everything set up, hit the "Send" button and you will receive a similar response to the following example response:

```
