The X API provides the following response and error codes to help understand and debug in the moment. Use the debugging guide and error index below for additional context.

Successful responses are indicated with a 200-series HTTP code and a JSON-based payload containing the object(s) requested, created, modified, or deleted along with an expression of the server's interpretation of your request.

Error responses are served with a non-200-series HTTP code. Different error codes indicate different reasons for an error. The X API attempts to return appropriate [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for every request.

## X API HTTP status codes

| Code | Text | Description | Troubleshooting tips |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- | :------------------- |
| 200 | OK | The request was successful! | |
| 304 | Not Modified | There was no new data to return. | |
| 400 | Bad Request	| The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. An accompanying error message will explain further. Requests without authentication or with invalid query parameters are considered invalid and will yield this response. | Double check the format of your JSON query. For example, if your rule contains double-quote characters associated with an exact-match or other operator, you may need to escape them using a backslash to distinguish them from the structure of the JSON format. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | There was a problem authenticating your request. This could be due to missing or incorrect authentication credentials. This may also be returned in other undefined circumstances. | Check that you are using the correct [authentication method](https://docs.x.com/resources/fundamentals/authentication/overview) and that your credentials are correct. |
| 403 | Forbidden | The request is understood, but it has been refused or access is not allowed. An accompanying error message will explain why. | Check that your developer account includes access to the endpoint you’re trying to use. You may also need to get your App allowlisted (e.g. Engagement API or Ads API) or sign up for access. |
| 404 | Not Found | The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested, such as a user, does not exist. | Check that you are using valid parameters and the correct URI for the endpoint you’re using. |
| 406 | Not Acceptable | Returned when an invalid format is specified in the request. Generally, this occurs where your client fails to properly include the headers to accept gzip encoding, but can occur in other circumstances as well. | Check that you are correctly passing expected query parameters, including expected headers, in your request. |
| 409 | Connection Exception | Returned when attempting to connect to a filtered stream that has no rules. | Check that you have created at least one rule on the stream you are connecting to. Filtered stream will only return Posts that match an active rule. If there are no rules, the stream will not return any Posts. |
| 410 | Gone | This resource is gone. Used to indicate that an API endpoint has been turned off. | |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | Returned when the data is unable to be processed. | Check that the data you are sending in your request is valid. For example, this data could be the JSON body of your request or an image. |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Returned when a request cannot be served due to the App's [rate limit](/resources/fundamentals/rate-limits) or [Post cap](/x-api/fundamentals/post-cap) having been exhausted. See [Rate Limiting](/resources/fundamentals/rate-limits). | Check the number of requests per timeframe allowed with the endpoint you’re using. Wait for the timeframe to reset. Space out your requests to ensure you don’t hit rate limits or upgrade to the next available data plan. |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Something is broken. This is usually a temporary error, for example in a high load situation or if an endpoint is temporarily having issues. | Check the X API [status page](/status) or the [developer community forum](https://devcommunity.x.com/) in case others are having similar issues, or simply wait and try again later. |
| 502 | Bad Gateway | X is down, or being upgraded | Check the X API [status page](/status) or the [developer community forum](https://devcommunity.x.com/) in case others are having similar issues, or simply wait and try again later. |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | The X servers are up, but overloaded with requests. Try again later. | Check the X API [status page](/status) or the [developer community forum](https://devcommunity.x.com/) in case others are having similar issues, or simply wait and try again later. |
| 504 | Gateway Timeout | The X servers are up, but the request couldn’t be serviced due to some failure within the internal stack. Try again later. | Check the X API [status page](/status) or the [developer community forum](https://devcommunity.x.com/) in case others are having similar issues, or simply wait and try again later. |

When an error is incurred during a request, detailed information about the error is returned in the response body to aid in diagnosing the problem. A type field, which is a URI, indicates the nature of the problem, while additional fields provide details about the problem. The type, title, and detail fields will always be returned in these bodies (see table below). Any additional fields, as in the example below, will vary depending on the type of the error.

```json
{
  "client_id": "101010101",
  "required_enrollment": "Standard Basic",
  "registration_url": "https://developer.twitter.com/en/account",
  "title": "Client Forbidden",
  "detail": "This request must be made using an approved developer account that is enrolled in the requested endpoint. Learn more by visiting our documentation.",
  "reason": "client-not-enrolled",
  "type": "https://api.x.com/2/problems/client-forbidden"
}
```

## Partial errors

In some cases you may see the errors detailed above in a response that returned a 200 status code. In those cases, the endpoint is designed to return the data that it can, while providing detailed errors about what it could not return.

For example, the [Posts lookup endpoint](/x-api/posts/lookup/introduction) allows a X [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps#overview) to request more than one ID. If some of those Posts are available, but one of them has been deleted, the available Posts would be returned in the data field of the response. An additional errors field would be returned in the payload, indicating which requested Post(s) could not be returned. The same format is used as full request errors to make diagnosing issues easier.

### Error information

Each problem type indicates the nature of the problem encountered. A full list of problems that you can run into can be found in our [API specification](https://api.x.com/2/openapi.json) as well.

The X API attempts to return appropriate [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for every request.

See [below](#x-api-error-codes) for machine-parseable error codes.

### X API error codes

In addition to [descriptive error text](#x-api-http-status-codes), error messages contain machine-parseable codes. While the text for an error message may change, the codes will stay the same.

The following table describes the codes which may appear when working with the X API (note that the Ads API and some other resource families may present additional error codes). If an error response is not listed in the table, fall back to examining the HTTP status codes above in order to determine the best way to address the issue. Please also use the above tables for troubleshooting tips for each corresponding HTTP status code.

## Troubleshooting tips

<Accordion title="Debugging your code">

When building an application, it's normal to run into errors or unexpected issues from time to time. Below are some tips for how you can debug your code: 

Start by breaking down the issue into smaller parts to identify where the problem lies. For example, if you’re integrating a REST or a streaming endpoint, the issue could lie with any of the following items:

- The endpoint requires proper [authentication](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/overview).
- The endpoint requires valid parameters and headers. Any filtering rules are built using the correct operators and proper [syntax](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/rules-filtering#building-rules-and-queries).
- The endpoint's URI must be correct and, in the case of REST endpoints, the correct HTTP method must be used.
- The data or resource you are trying to access is not accessible to you (for example, private data is only available to authenticated users).
- Your current data package gives you access to certain endpoints only and to specific rate limits. Check out your [developer portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/products) for more details.
- Your code uses a third-party library to integrate the endpoint in your code.
- Your code needs to successfully parse the endpoint response.

Read the accompanying error message. This should give you a good indication of what the problem is. Use the tables in the [error and response codes section](#x-api-http-status-codes) for troubleshooting tips specific to each error code.

For REST endpoints, you can use a REST client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to validate steps (1) to (5) above (review our ["Getting started with Postman"](/tutorials/postman-getting-started) guide). If the request with the REST client returns a 200 success status code, you can assume that the issue lies with your code or the library that you are using; not with the endpoint request itself.

For streaming endpoints, you can use cURL (a command-line tool for getting or sending requests using the URL syntax) to check if the issue lies with the request to the endpoint (steps (1) to (5) above) or with your code itself (steps (6) to (7) above).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication issues">
- Check that you are using the proper [authentication method](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/overview) required for the endpoint. This can be identified via the endpoint’s API reference page.
- Check that your authentication credentials are correct. You can check or regenerate your App keys and tokens in the [Apps section](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps) of your developer dashboard (under “Details”).
- Check that you have properly [authorized your OAuth 1.0a request](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-1-0a/authorizing-a-request) with `oauth_nonce`, `oauth_signature`, and `oauth_timestamp` for your request.
- If the issue persists, consider using an OAuth library, a REST client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), or [xurl](https://github.com/xdevplatform/xurl).

Review our [guide on authentication](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/overview) for additional information on all of the above.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate limiting and Post cap issues">

A 429 error can deliver if you hit a rate limit for a given endpoint, or if you hit a Post cap.

If the specific ‘Too many requests’ error is returned, you hit the endpoint's rate limit. In other words, you've exceeded the maximum number of requests allowed for an endpoint per specified time period. 

Note that rate limits are set per-App and per-user levels. 

- **X App level** indicates the number of requests allowed when using OAuth 2.0 App-Only, where rate limits are determined globally for the entire App. For example, if a method allows for 15 requests per rate limit window, then it allows you to make 15 requests per window on behalf of your X App. This limit is considered completely separately from the user-level limit. Read more in our guide on [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only).
- **User-context level** indicates the number of requests that can be made per user Access Token when using OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE. For example, if a method allows for 15 requests per rate limit window, then it allows 15 requests per window and per user Access Token. Read more in our guide on how to obtain a user’s Access Tokens with [OAuth 1.0a](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens) and [OAuth 2.0](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token).

Start by checking the rate limits for the endpoint you are using. You can find this information in the endpoint's API reference page and in the new developer portal dashboard.

Review our documentation for additional information on rate limits, including how to use HTTP headers to track where your App is at for a given rate limit, how to recover from a rate limit 429 error code, and tips to avoid being rate limited in the first place:

- [Rate limits for v2 endpoints](/x-api/fundamentals/rate-limits)

If you've received the specific "Usage cap exceeded: Monthly product cap" error, that means you've hit the Post cap for your access level. We have plenty of details on what these [Post caps](/x-api/fundamentals/post-cap) are on our documentation page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing Post issues">

Follow the steps below, if you expected a Post to be returned, but it wasn’t delivered by the endpoint.

- Check your rule to ensure that you are using the correct [operators](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/rules-filtering#enterprise-operators) and [syntax](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/rules-filtering#building-rules-and-queries). Break the rule into smaller clauses to ensure that you are using the correct syntax.
- If the account from which the Post was sent was [protected](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/public-and-protected-tweets) at the time the Post was created, the Post won’t be returned - even if the account is public at the time of the request to the endpoint. You can typically check this using [X Advanced Search](https://x.com/search-advanced): if a Post is not surfaced using the X Advanced Search functionality, you should assume that it won’t be returned by the endpoint.

The following steps apply to streaming endpoints only:

- Were you connected to the stream when the Post was sent? Remember that the timestamp delivered in the Post object indicates time in UTC. If you experienced a disconnect when the Post was sent, review the [recovery and redundancy features](/x-api/posts/filtered-stream/integrate/recovery-and-redundancy-features#recovery-and-redundancy) available to backfill any missed data.
- Was your rule in place when the Post was sent? Remember that the timestamp delivered in the Post object indicates time in UTC.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhook issues">
<AccordionGroup >
<Accordion title="Code 32 - Could not authenticate you">

This error generally means that something is either malformed in the request, headers, authorization, or the URI that you are specifying. This is not an [Account Activity API](/x-api/account-activity/introduction) (premium or enterprise) error, it’s an authorization error and X isn’t getting the proper OAuth setup or URI.

- Free/Pro/Basic - Make sure you have an approved [developer account](/resources/fundamentals/developer-portal#overview), have established a [dev environment](/resources/fundamentals/developer-portal#overview) for the Account Activity API. You must use the proper environment name and App tokens in your request.
- Enterprise - Make sure the consumer keys and access tokens you are using belong to a [X App](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/apps) that has been allowlisted for use of Enterprise products. If you don't have your consumer keys and access tokens, or need to allowlist your X App, please reach out to your account manager.
- If you are trying to register a webhook, the [POST :env_name/webhooks](https://developer.x.com/en#post-account-activity-all-env-name-webhooks) endpoint requires that you replace `:env_name` with your environment name in the request. Also, this endpoint requires that you authenticate using [OAuth1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-1-0a/api-key-and-secret), meaning that you need to use the consumer keys and access tokens generated by the [X App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps#overview) that you selected as your designated dev environment.
- If authenticating with [OAuth1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-1-0a/api-key-and-secret), make sure you have properly [authorized your request](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-1-0a/authorizing-a-request) with the proper `oauth_nonce`, `oauth_signature`, and `oauth_timestamp`.
- Make sure that your access tokens have the proper permission level.
    1. When on the 'Keys and tokens' tab in the [App section](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps#overview) of your developer dashboard, please make sure that your access tokens have the 'Read, write, and direct messages' [permission level](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps#app-permissions).
    2. If the tokens' permission level is set to anything less than this, please navigate to the 'Permissions' tab, adjust the access permission to 'Read, write, and direct messages', then regenerate your access tokens and secret from the 'Keys and tokens' tab.
- Make sure that your URI is formed properly. Please keep in mind that `:env_name` is case sensitive.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Code 200 - Forbidden">
- Free/Basic/Pro - Make sure that you have an approved [developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/developer-portal/overview) before you try to make a request to the API. You also must use the proper `:env_name` in the request, which you can set up on the [dev environments](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/developer-portal/overview) section of your developer portal.
- Enterprise - Make sure that your account manager has set you up with access to the Account Activity API.
- Make sure you have set up your URI properly. This error can trigger if you have entered the incorrect URI in your request.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Code 214 - Webhook URI does not meet the requirements">
- Please make sure that you are using https.
- Your webhook URI could be malformed.
- Learn more about how to set up your webhook URI under the [Develop webhook consumer App](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium/account-activity-api/guides/getting-started-with-webhooks#webhook-url) section on [Getting started with webhooks](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium/account-activity-api/guides/getting-started-with-webhooks) page.

<Accordion title="Code 214 - High latency on CRC GET request. Your webhook should respond in less than 3 seconds.">
- This means that your server is slow. Make sure that you are responding to the CRC within 3 seconds.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Code 214 - Non-200 response code during CRC GET request (i.e. 404, 500, etc).">
- Your server is down. Make sure that your server is running properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Code 214 - Too many resources already created">
- Enterprise - You have already used all of your webhooks. Use the [GET webhooks](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium/account-activity-api/api-reference/aaa-enterprise#get-account-activity-webhooks) endpoint with each of your allowlisted Apps to identify where your webhooks are distributed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Code 261 - App cannot perform write actions">
- The App that you are using with the API does not have the proper [permission level](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps#app-permissions) set for its access token and access token secret. Please navigate to the 'Keys and tokens' tab on the X [Apps](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps#overview) dashboard and check the permission levels assigned to your access token and access token secret. If it is set to anything other than 'Read, write and Direct Messages,' then you are going to have to adjust the settings under the 'Permission' tab and regenerate your access token and access token secret to apply the new settings.
- Alternatively, you are trying to register a webhook using OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token authentication, which is not supported. Please authenticate with [OAuth1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-1-0a/api-key-and-secret) instead as noted in the API reference sections for registering a webhook for [enterprise Account Activity API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity#enterprise-account-activity-api) and [premium Account Activity API](https://developer.x.com/en#post-account-activity-all-env-name-webhooks).

<Accordion title="Full buffer disconnect issues">
You may get one of the following errors when your stream is not keeping up with the speed at which we are delivering data and your App isn't consuming the data from the stream fast enough:

```
This stream has been disconnected because your client was unable to keep up with us.
```

```
This stream has been disconnected for operational reasons.
```

We allow delivery to get behind for a period of time, and we have a temporary staging buffer amount for each stream on our side; but if you don't catch up, we initiate a disconnect to allow you to reconnect at the current point in time. Please note that this may lead to data loss (for data that is within the buffer at the time of the full buffer disconnect).

These can occur around large spikes in data. Generally, we recommend using a buffer process for consuming data quickly that is separate from the processing process.

If you are an enterprise customer using v1.1 endpoints, you can find out more about optimizing your App to prevent disconnects like this in our articles on [connection](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api#disconnections-explained) and on consuming streaming data [here](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/tutorials/consuming-streaming-data) and [here](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api#planning-for-high-volume-social-data-events).

There is a range of tools available for retrieving missed Posts due to a disconnect, including the ones listed below. Note that the following tools are only available with v1.1 endpoints at enterprise level of access.

- [**Redundant Connections**](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api#recovery-and-redundancy-features) - With multiple connections, consume the stream from multiple servers to prevent missed data when one is disconnected.
- [**Replay**](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api#recovery-and-redundancy-features) - Recover data from within the last 5 days using a separate stream.
- [**Backfill**](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api#recovery-and-redundancy-features) - Reconnect within 5 minutes and start from where you left off.
- **Historical PowerTrack** - Recover data from the entire X archive.
