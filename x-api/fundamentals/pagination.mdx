## Introduction

Pagination is a feature in X API v2 endpoints that return more results than can be returned in a single response. When that happens, the data is returned in a series of "pages." Pagination refers to methods for programmatically requesting all the pages to retrieve the entire result data set. Not all API endpoints support or require pagination, but it is often used when result sets are large.

      ### Use cases for pagination

      **To retrieve all results for a request:** Pagination should be used to receive all relevant data related to a specific request and parameters. Pagination is required in cases where there are more matching results than the `max_results` for a request. Looping requests with pagination tokens allows you to retrieve all results. Once a response is returned without a `next_token` value, it can be assumed that all results have been paged through. Pagination should not be used for polling purposes. To get the most recent results since a previous request, review polling with `since_id`.

      **To traverse through the results of a request:** Pagination provides directional options for navigating through results from a request, using `next_token` and `previous_token` values from responses. These tokens can be set as the `pagination_token` in the following request to go to the next or previous page of results.

      ### Pagination token definitions

      - `next_token` - Opaque string returned within the meta object response on endpoints that support pagination. Indicates that more results are available and can be used as the `pagination_token` parameter in the next request to return the next page of results. The last page of results will not have a `next_token` present.
      - `previous_token` - Opaque string returned withins the meta object response on endpoints that support pagination. Indicates that there is a previous page of results available and can be set as the `pagination_token` parameter in the next request to return the previous page of results.
      - `pagination_token` - Parameter used in pagination requests. Set to the value of `next_token` for the next page of results. Set to the value of `previous_token` for the previous page of results.

      ### Fundamentals of pagination

      - Endpoints that use pagination will respond to an initial request with the first page of results and provide a `next_token` within the meta object in the JSON response if additional pages of results are available. To receive all results, repeat this process until no `next_token` is included in the response.
      - Results are delivered in reverse-chronological order. This is true within individual pages, as well as across multiple pages:
        - The first Post in the first response will be the most recent.
        - The last Post in the last response will be the oldest.
      - The `max_results` request parameter allows you to configure the number of Posts returned per response page. There is a default and maximum `max_results`.
      - Every pagination implementation will involve parsing tokens from the response payload, which can be used in subsequent requests.
      - In some circumstances, you may get fewer than the `max_results` per page. Do not rely on the results per page always equaling the `max_results` parameter value.
      - The best ways to use pagination for complete results are by using loop logic within integration code or by using a [library](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries) that supports X API v2.

      ### Pagination example

      Here, there are three pages of results because `max_results` is set to `100`, and there are approximately 295 Posts created by user ID `2244994945` (@XDevelopers) between January 1, 2019, at 17:00:00 UTC and December 12 at 00:00:00 UTC. The first Post on the first page (`1337498609819021312`) is the most recent, and the last Post on the third page of results (`1082718487011885056`) is the oldest.

      #### Initial request

      ```bash
      https://api.x.com/2/users/2244994945/tweets?tweet.fields=created_at&max_results=100&start_time=2019-01-01T17:00:00Z&end_time=2020-12-12T01:00:00Z
      ```
