title: "Versioning"
---


<p>Along with X API v2, we launched a new versioning strategy that enables developers to better understand when to expect changes to X's public APIs, and when they will need to migrate to new versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developers will be notified of deprecations, retirements, changes, and additions to the X API via our <a href="https://developer.x.com/en/updates/stay-informed">communication channels</a> so they can appropriately plan to accommodate these changes in their development roadmap. All changes to the API will be noted in the changelog.</p>
<p>The X API currently has three different versions. We strongly encourage users to utilize X API v2 when planning their integration unless we have not released functionality to v2 that is required by your use case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about each version, please visit the following pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/x-api/introduction">X API v2</a></li>
<li>Gnip 2.0 (<a href="/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/enterprise-gnip">enterprise</a>)</li>
</ul>

## Versioning Strategy

<p>Versioning for the X API will be represented by version numbers declared in the route path for our endpoints:</p>
<p>`https://api.x.com/2/tweets`</p>
<p>We aim to release major versions of the X API as necessary but no more frequently than every 12 months. A major version will be released when breaking changes are introduced in the API. We will publish migration guides when launching a new major version to help developers migrate over to the new version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A breaking change requires developers to change their code to maintain existing functionality in their app. Non-breaking changes will be additive and rolled out to the most recent version when ready, requiring no work on a developer’s end unless you would like to take advantage of the new functionality.</p>
<p>If a breaking change must be rolled out mid-cycle (for security or privacy reasons), this change will be made to the most recent version.</p>

### Breaking changes

<p>These changes require developers to change their code to maintain existing functionality of their application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition of a new required parameter</li>
<li>Removal of an existing endpoint</li>
<li>Removal of any field in the response (either required or optional)</li>
<li>Removal of a query parameter</li>
<li>Restructuring of the input or output format (for example, making a top-level field a sub-field, or changing the location of errors to be inline)</li>
<li>Changing the name or data type of an existing input parameter or output value</li>
<li>Changing the name of a field</li>
<li>Changing the resource name</li>
<li>Changing a response code</li>
<li>Changing error types</li>
<li>Changes to existing authorization scopes</li>
</ul>

### Non-breaking changes

<ul>
<li>Addition of a new endpoint</li>
<li>Addition of a new optional parameter</li>
<li>Addition of a new response field</li>
<li>Changing text in error messages</li>
<li>Availability of new scopes</li>
<li>“Nulling” of fields (changing the value of a to null for privacy/security reasons as an alternative to removing it altogether)</li>
</ul>

### Deprecation and retirement

<p>First of all, here is our definition of what deprecation and retirement mean to the X API:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Deprecation:</b> The feature is no longer supported by the team. No new functionality will be released around that feature, and if there are any bugs or issues with the product, the chances that we will explore a fix are extremely low.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Retired:</b> The feature will no longer be accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, as soon as a new version is released, the previous version will be marked as deprecated. Versions will remain in a deprecated state for a period of time, after which they will be retired.&nbsp;</p>
