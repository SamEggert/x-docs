#### Manage follows: Standard v1.1 compared to X API v2

If you have been working with the standard v1.1 [POST friendships/create](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/post-friendships-create) and [POST friendships/destroy](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/post-friendships-destroy) endpoints, the goal of this guide is to help you understand the similarities and differences between the standard and X API v2 manage follows endpoints.

* **Similarities**
    * OAuth 1.0a User Context
* **Differences**
    * Endpoint URLs
    * App and Project requirements
    * HTTP methods
    * Request parameters

         

#### Similarities

**OAuth 1.0a User Context authentication method**

Both the endpoint versions support [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-1-0a-2). Therefore, if you were previously using one of the standard v1.1 manage follows endpoints, you can continue using the same authentication method if you migrate to the X API v2 version. 

#### Differences

**Endpoint URLs**

* Standard v1.1 endpoints:
    * POST https://api.x.com/1.1/friendships/create.json
        (follow a user)
    * POST https://api.x.com/1.1/friendships/destroy.json
        (unfollow a user)
* X API v2 endpoint:
    * POST https://api.x.com/2/users/:id/following
        (follow a user)
    * DELETE https://api.x.com/2/users/:source\_user\_id/following/:target\_user\_id
        (unfollow a user) 

**App and Project requirements**

The X API v2 endpoints require that you use credentials from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is associated to a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) when authenticating your requests. All X API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a project.


**Request parameters**

The following standard v1.1 request parameters have equivalents in X API v2:

| Standard v1.1 | X API v2 |
| --- | --- |
| No equivalent | id (POST), source\_user\_id (DELETE) |
| user_id | target\_user\_id |
| screen_name | No equivalent |

Please note that the Standard v1.1 parameters are passed as query parameters, whereas the X API v2 parameters are passed as body parameters (for the POST endpoint) or path parameters (for the DELETE endpoint).

Also, the v2 id and source\_user\_id are not required when using the standard v1.1 endpoints since the Access Tokens passed with OAuth 1.0a User Context inferred which user was initiating the follow/unfollow.
