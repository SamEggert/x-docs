You can authenticate your request to all users lookup endpoints other than the authenticated user lookup with [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication), [App only](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#app-only-authentication-and-oauth-2-0-bearer-token), or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2). However, if you would like to access private metrics or data from private users, you will need to utilize OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE, and pass the authenticated users' Access Token with your request.    

This endpoint is commonly used to receive up-to-date details on a user, to verify that a user exists, or to update your stored details following a compliance event.

### Authenticated user lookup

If authenticating on behalf of other users, it is critical to be able to see who you can make a request on behalf of.

This endpoint requires you to use [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2). It returns information about the authorized user, meaning the user that is associated with the user Access Tokens that you pass with the request.

You can access this endpoint via the GET method. There is a user rate limit of 75 requests per 15 minutes for this endpoint.
<Note>
**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved [developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is located within a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects).
