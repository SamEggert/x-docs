The Direct Messages endpoints v2 introduce conversations and conversation events as core X API objects, and make a distinction between 1-1 and group conversations. 1-1 conversations always have two, and only two, participants, while group conversations can have two or more and memberships that can change.   

This page contains information on several tools and key concepts that you should be aware of as you integrate the Direct Messages lookup endpoints into your system. We’ve broken the page into two sections:

### Key Concepts

### Direct Message conversations

All Direct Messages are part of a Direct Message conversation. These conversations can be one-to-one conversations or group conversations. This launch provides the foundational endpoints needed to create Direct Messages and retrieve events associated with Direct Message conversations. All conversations have a unique dm\_conversation\_id, and the events that make up that conversation all have a unique dm\_event\_id.  

The Direct Message lookup endpoints provide methods for retrieving events associated with conversations. These GET endpoints are used to retrieve the messages that make up a conversation, and for group conversations, can be used to understand who has joined and left group conversations.

This initial release of Direct Messages lookup includes three GET methods:

* **GET /2/dm\_conversations/with/:participant\_id/dm_events** \- Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a one-to-one conversation. The :participant_id path parameter is the numeric User ID of the account having the conversation with the authenticated user making this request.  

* **GET /2/dm\_conversations/:dm\_conversation\_id/dm\_events** \- Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a specific conversation ID, as indicated by the :dm\_conversation\_id path parameter. Both one-to-one and group conversations IDs are supported.  

* **GET /2/dm_events** \- Retrieves Direct Message events associated with the authenticating user, including both one-to-one and group conversations. Events from up to 30 days ago are available.  


These GET endpoints all support retrieving dm_events by event type with an event_types request query parameters. Currently, there are three conversation event types supported:

* **MessageCreate** \- Created when a new Direct Message is created. This event object can include the time and text of the message, along with the account ID of who sent the message, and the conversation and event IDs. 

* **ParticipantsJoin** \- Created when a new participant joins a group conversation. This dm_event object includes the ID of the participant joining, along with the created\_at time and the sender\_id of the 'invite' event. 

* **ParticipantsLeave** \- Created when a participant leaves a conversation.This event object includes the ID of the participant leaving, along with the time of the event. 


For more information see the [Direct Messages lookup API References](/x-api/direct-messages/get-dm-events-for-a-dm-conversation).

### Shared conversation and event IDs across v1.1 and v2

An important concept is that conversation and event IDs are shared across v1.1 and v2 versions of the X Platform. This means both versions can be used together. For example, the Direct Messages v1.1 endpoints provide methods for returning a single event and for deleting events, methods not yet available with v2. Since IDs are common across v1.1 and v2, you can make v1.1 requests based on IDs provided by v2, or by referencing conversation IDs displayed in conversation URLs on the X application.  

### Direct Message event fields and expansions

The X API v2 allows users to select exactly which data they want to return from the API using a set of tools called fields and expansions. For example, Direct Message lookup endpoints support the following dm_events fields: 

* id, event_type, and text are the defaults for MessageCreate events. 

* id, event_type, and participant_ids are the defaults for ParticipantsJoin and ParticipantsLeave events.

* dm\_conversation\_id and created_at are available for all events.

* attachments and referenced_tweets are available for MessageCreate events. 

* sender_id is available for MessageCreate and ParticipantsJoin events. 

* participant_ids is available for ParticipantsJoin and ParticipantsLeave events. 


In addition, the Direct Message lookup endpoints support the following [expansions](/x-api/fundamentals/expansions):

* sender_id \- Expands the User object associated with who sent the message or who invited someone to the conversation. 

* referenced_tweets.id \- Expands the Post object if the Direct Message text includes a link to a Post. 

* attachments.media_keys \- Expands the Media object if the Direct Message includes a media attachment. 

* participant_ids \- Expands the User object associated with who joined or left a group conversation.


Since expansion include Posts, Users, and Media objects, you can also use the tweet.fields, user.fields, and media.fields request query parameters. See our guide on how to [use fields and expansions](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary#how-to-use-fields-and-expansions) for more information.

### Conversation event types

Below are example JSON objects for Direct Message the MessageCreate, ParticipantsJoin, and ParticipantsLeave event types. 

Available dm_event object fields: id, text, event_type, dm\_conversation\_id, created_at, sender_id, attachments, referenced_tweets, participant_ids. See the the Fields and Expansion section for more details on selecting these fields in your requests. 

Example MessageCreate event: 

With all the dm_event fields specified, here is the response for a simple text Direct Message: 

      `{
    "text": "Hi everyone.",
    "sender_id": "944480690",
    "dm_conversation_id": "1578398451921985538",
    "id": "1582838499983564806",
    "event_type": "MessageCreate",
    "created_at": "2022-10-19T20:58:00.000Z"
}`


Example ParticipantsJoin event:

With all the dm_event fields specified, here is the response for a participant joining a conversation:

      `{
    "participant_ids": [
        "944480690"
    ],
    "sender_id": "17200003",
    "dm_conversation_id": "1578398451921985538",
    "id": "1582835469712138240",
    "event_type": "ParticipantsJoin",
    "created_at": "2022-10-19T20:45:58.000Z"
}`


Example ParticipantsLeave event:

With all the dm_event fields specified, here is the response for a participant leaving a conversation:

      `{
    "participant_ids": [
        "944480690"
    ],
    "dm_conversation_id": "1578398451921985538",
    "id": "1582838535115067392",
    "event_type": "ParticipantsLeave",
    "created_at": "2022-10-19T20:58:09.000Z"
    }`


### Authentication

All X API v2 endpoints require for you to authenticate your requests with a set of credentials, also known as keys and tokens. All Direct Messages are private and require user authorization to access them. 

These Direct Message endpoints require the use of [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow with PKCE](/x-api/posts/manage-tweets) or [1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication), which means that you must use a set of API keys and user Access Tokens to make a successful request. The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are requesting on behalf of. If you want to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize or authenticate your App using the [3-legged OAuth flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow).

Please note that OAuth user-context can be tricky to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend using a [library](/x-api/tools-and-libraries/overview) or a tool like Postman to properly authenticate your requests. 

[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2) allows for greater control over an application’s scope, and authorization flows across multiple devices. OAuth 2.0 allows you to pick specific fine-grained scopes which give you specific permissions on behalf of a user. The Direct Messages lookup endpoints require these scopes:  dm.read, post.read, user.read

To enable OAuth 2.0 in your App, you must enable it in your’s App’s authentication settings found in the App settings section of the developer portal.

### Developer portal, Projects, and developer Apps

To retrieve a set of authentication credentials that will work with the X API v2 endpoints, you must have an approved developer account, set up a Project within that account, and create a developer App within that Project. You can then find your keys and tokens within your developer App. 

### Rate limits

Everyday many thousands of developers make requests to the X API. To help manage the sheer volume of these requests, rate limits are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that you can make on behalf of your app or on behalf of an authenticated user. 

The Direct Message lookup endpoints are rate limited at the user-level, meaning that the authenticated user that you are making the request on behalf of can only make a certain number of requests with your X App. There is a user rate limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes for the GET methods. These rate limits are shared across the GET endpoints. 

### Pagination

These endpoints utilize pagination so that responses are returned quickly. In cases where there are more results than what can be sent in a single response (up to 100 events) you will need to paginate. Use the max_results parameter to identify how many results will return per page, and the pagination_token parameter to return the next page of results. You can learn more by reviewing our [pagination guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination).

**Helpful tools**

Here are some helpful tools we encourage you to explore as you work with the Direct Messages lookup endpoints: 

****Postman****

Postman is a great tool that you can use to test out an endpoint. Each Postman request includes every path and body parameter to help you quickly understand what is available to you. To learn more about our Postman collections, please visit our [Using Postman](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/postman-getting-started) page. 

****Code samples****

Python sample code for the v2 Direct Messages endpoints is available in our [X API v2 sample code GitHub](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code) repository. The "Manage-Direct-Messages" folder contains examples for the POST methods, and the "Direct-Messages-lookup" folder contains examples for the GET methods.

****XDev Software Development Kits (SDKs)****

These [libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries/sdks/overview) are being updated for the v2 Direct Messages endpoints and should be ready soon:

* [X API Java SDK](https://github.com/xdevplatform/twitter-api-java-sdk) \- Official Java SDK for the X API v2
* [X API TypeScript/JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/xdevplatform/twitter-api-typescript-sdk) \- Official TS/JS SDK for the X API v2

**Third-party libraries**

There is a growing number of [third-party libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries/v2#community-libraries) developed by our community. These libraries are designed to help you get started, and several are expected to support v2 Direct Messages endpoints soon. You can find a library that works with the v2 endpoints by looking for the proper version tag.
