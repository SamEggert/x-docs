This initial release of Direct Messages lookup includes three GET methods:

* **GET /2/dm\_conversations/with/:participant\_id/dm_events** \- Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a one-to-one conversation. The :participant_id path parameter is the User ID of the account having the conversation with the authenticated user making this request. 
* **GET /2/dm\_conversations/:dm\_conversation\_id/dm\_events** \- Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a specific conversation ID, as indicated by the :dm\_conversation\_id path parameter. 
* **GET /2/dm_events** \- Retrieves Direct Message events associated with a user, including both one-to-one and group conversations. Events from up to 30 days ago are available.  

Note that Direct Message event IDs are common across the v1.1 and v2 (as well as the X App), so the v1.1 method to list a single event can be used along with these new v2 endpoints. Also note that the Enterprise and Premium Account Activity APIs support v2 one-to-one messages, but do not yet support group conversations.   

With this release, three event types are supported, and these endpoints support query parameters to filter on them:

* **MessageCreate** \- A message has been created. 
* **ParticipantsJoin** \- A new participant has joined a conversation. 
* **ParticipantsLeave** \- A participant has left a conversation. 

There is a user rate limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes for the GET methods. This rate limit is shared across these GET endpoints.

Since you are making requests on behalf of a user with Direct Message v2 endpoints, you must authenticate with either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-3), using Access Tokens associated with users that have authorized your X App. To generate these Access Tokens with OAuth 1.0a, you can use the [3-legged OAuth flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow). To generate user Access Tokens with OAuth 2.0, you can use the [Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2).

**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved [developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is located within a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects).
