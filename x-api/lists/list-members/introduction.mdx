### List members lookup

Members lookup group has two available endpoints. You are able to retrieve details on members of a specified List and see which Lists a user is a member of. These endpoints can be used to enable people to curate and organize new Lists based on the membership information.

There is a rate limit of 900 requests per 15 minutes when looking up member details and a limit of 75 requests per 15 minutes when looking up user memberships.

You can use [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication), [App only](https://developer.x.com(/resources/fundamentals/authentication#app-only-authentication-and-oauth-2-0-bearer-token), or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2) to authenticate your requests to this endpoint. 
 

### Manage List members

The manage List members endpoints allow you to add and remove members to a List on behalf of an authenticated user. For these endpoints, there are two methods available: POST and DELETE. The POST method allows you to add a member to a List, and the DELETE method allows you to remove a member from a List. There is a user rate limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes for both endpoints.

Note that Lists cannot have more than 5,000 members.

Since you are making requests on behalf of a user with the these endpoints, you must authenticate them with either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2), and use the user Access Tokens associated with a user that has authorized your App, which can be generated using the [3-legged OAuth flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow) (OAuth 1.0a) or the [Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#how-to-connect-to-endpoints-using-oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)) (OAuth 2.0).
<Note>
**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved [developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is located within a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects).
