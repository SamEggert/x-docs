Pinning lists allows X users to more easily access lists that they've either subscribed to or created themselves.

Since you are making requests on behalf of a user with the these endpoints, you must authenticate them with either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2), and use the user Access Tokens associated with a user that has authorized your App, which can be generated using the [3-legged OAuth flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow) (OAuth 1.0a) or the [Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#how-to-connect-to-endpoints-using-oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)) (OAuth 2.0).

### Pinned List lookup

Pinned List lookup has one available endpoint that allows you to retrieve an authenticated user's pinned Lists. There is a rate limit of 15 requests per 15 minutes for this endpoint.
 

### Manage pinned Lists

The manage pinned List endpoints allow you to pin and unpin a List on behalf of an authenticated user. For these endpoints, there are two methods available: POST and DELETE. The POST method allows you to pin a List, and the DELETE method allows you to unpin a List. There is a user rate limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes for both endpoints.
<Note>
**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved [developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info)).
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is located within a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects).
