## Getting started with the pinned List endpoint group

This quick overview will help you make your first request to the pinned List endpoints using [Postman](/tutorials/postman-getting-started).

Please visit our [X API v2 sample code](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code) GitHub repository if you want to see sample code in different languages.
<Note>
### Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need to have a set of [keys and tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) to authenticate your request. You can generate these keys and tokens by following these steps:

* [Sign up for a developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/apply-for-access) and receive approval.
* Create a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) and an associated [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) in the developer portal.
* Navigate to your App's “Keys and tokens” page to generate the required credentials. Make sure to save all credentials in a secure location.
</Note>

#### Authenticate your request

To make a successful request to **lookup** endpoints, you can use either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication), [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0), or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2). However, with **manage** endpoints, you can only authenticate with OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE.

Regardless, when using Postman, the default authentication keys and tokens will automatically populate in your requests as long as you've set up your environment properly. 

You can do this by selecting the environment named “X API v2” (in the top-right corner of Postman), and adding your keys and tokens to the "initial value" and "current value" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown). These keys include the following:

* API Key (also known as Consumer Key)
* API Secret Key (also known as Consumer Secret)
* OAuth 1.0a user Access Token
* OAuth 1.0a user Access Token Secret
* OAuth 2.0 App Access Token
* OAuth 2.0 Client Key (only available if you've set up OAuth 2.0 User Authentication settings in your App's settings)
* OAuth 2.0 Client Secret (only available if you've set up OAuth 2.0 User Authentication settings in your App's settings)
