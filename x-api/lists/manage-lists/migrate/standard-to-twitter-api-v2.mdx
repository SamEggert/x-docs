### Manage Lists: Standard v1.1 compared to X API v2

If you have been working with the standard v1.1 [POST lists/create](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/post-lists-create), [POST lists/destroy](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/post-lists-destroy), and [POST lists/update](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/post-lists-update) endpoints, the goal of this guide is to help you understand the similarities and differences between the standard v1.1 and X API v2 manage List endpoints.

* **Similarities**
    * Authentication
* **Differences**
    * Endpoint URLs
    * App and Project requirements
    * HTTP methods
    * Rate limits
    * Request parameters

#### Similarities

**Authentication**

Both endpoint versions support [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/resources/fundamentals/authentication). Therefore, if you were previously using one of the standard v1.1 manage Lists endpoints, you can continue using the same authentication method if you migrate to the X API v2 version.

#### Differences

**Endpoint URLs**

* Standard v1.1 endpoints:
    * POST https://api.x.com/1.1/lists/create.json
        (Creates a List)
    * POST https://api.x.com/1.1/lists/destroy.json
        (Deletes a List)
    * POST https://api.x.com/1.1/lists/update.json
        (Updates a List)
* X API v2 endpoint:
    * POST https://api.x.com/2/lists
        (Creates a List)

    * DELETE https://api.x.com/2/lists/:id
        (Deletes a List)

    * PUT https://api.x.com/2/lists/:id
        (Updates a List)



**Rate limits**

| **Standard v1.1** | **X API v2** |
| :--- | :--- |
| /1.1/lists/create.json<br/><br/>none | /2/lists<br/><br/>300 requests per 15-minute window with OAuth 1.0a User Context |
| /1.1/lists/destroy.json<br/><br/>none | /2/lists/:id<br/><br/>300 requests per 15-minute window with OAuth 1.0a User Context |
| /1.1/lists/update.json<br/><br/>none | /2/lists/:id<br/><br/>300 requests per 15-minute window with OAuth 1.0a User Context |

**App and Project requirements**

The X API v2 endpoints require that you use credentials from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) associated with a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) when authenticating your requests. All X API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps related to a project.

**Request parameters**

The following standard v1.1 request parameters have equivalents in X API v2:

**Create a List**

| **Standard** | **X API v2** |
| :--- | :--- |
| name | name |
| mode | private |
| description | description |

**Delete/Update a List**

| **Standard** | **X API v2** |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner\_screen\_name | No equivalent |
| owner_id | No equivalent |
| list_id | id  |
| slug | No equivalent |

<Note>
**Please note:**Â Standard v1.1 parameters are passed as query parameters, whereas the X API v2 parameters are passed as body parameters (for the POST endpoint) or path parameters (for the DELETE and PUT endpoints).
