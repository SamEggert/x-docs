This page contains information on several tools and critical concepts that you should know as you integrate the Lists endpoints into your system. We’ve broken the page into a couple of different sections:

* [Helpful tools](#helpful)
* Key Concepts
* [Authentication](#authentication)
* [Developer portal, Projects, and Apps](#portal)
* [Rate limits](#limits)

### Helpful tools

Before we dive into some key concepts that will help you integrate this endpoint, we recommend that you become familiar with:

#### Postman

Postman is a great tool that you can use to test out an endpoint. Each Postman request includes every path and body parameter to help you quickly understand what is available to you. To learn more about our Postman collections, please visit our ["Using Postman"](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/tutorials/postman-getting-started) page. 

#### Code samples

Are you interested in getting set up with this endpoint with some code in your preferred coding language? We’ve got a handful of different code samples available that you can use as a starting point on our [Github page](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code).

#### Third-party libraries

Take advantage of one of our communities’ [third-party libraries](/x-api/tools-and-libraries/overview) to help you get started. You can find a library that works with the v2 endpoints by looking for the proper version tag.

### Key concepts

#### Authentication

All X API v2 endpoints require you to authenticate your requests with a set of credentials, also known as keys and tokens. 

These specific endpoints requires the use of [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication), which means that you must use a set of API keys and user Access Tokens to make a successful request. The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are making the request on behalf of. If you would like to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize or authenticate your App using the [3-legged OAuth flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow).

Please note that OAuth 1.0a can be tricky to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend that you use a [library](/x-api/tools-and-libraries/overview) or a tool like Postman to properly authenticate your requests.
 

#### Developer portal, Projects, and developer Apps

To retrieve a set of authentication credentials that will work with the X API v2 endpoints, you must [sign up for a developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info), set up a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) within that account, and created a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) within that Project. You can then find your keys and tokens within your developer App.
 

#### Rate limits

Every day, many thousands of developers make requests to the X API. To help manage the sheer volume of these requests, [rate limits](/x-api/fundamentals/rate-limits) are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that you can make on behalf of your app or on behalf of an authenticated user. 

These endpoints are rate limited at the user level, meaning that the authenticated user that you are making the request on behalf of can only call the endpoint a certain number of times across any developer App. 

The chart below shows the rate limits for each endpoint.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Endpoint** | **HTTP method** | **Rate limit** |
| /2/lists | POST | 300 requests per 15 minutes |
| /2/lists/:id | DELETE / PUT | 300 requests per 15 minutes |
