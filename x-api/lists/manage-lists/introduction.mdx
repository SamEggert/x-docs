[X Lists](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists) allows users to customize, organize and prioritize the Posts they see in their timeline. With the Lists endpoints, you can build solutions that enable people to curate and organize Posts based on preferences, interests, groups, or topics.

Since you are making requests on behalf of a user with the manage List endpoints, you must authenticate these endpoints with either [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) or [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2), and use the user Access Tokens associated with a user that has authorized your App, which can be generated using the [3-legged OAuth flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow) (OAuth 1.0a) or the [Authorization Code with PKCE grant flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#how-to-connect-to-endpoints-using-oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)) (OAuth 2.0).
 

### Manage Lists

The manage List endpoints allow you to create, delete, and update Lists on behalf of an authenticated user. For these endpoints, there are three methods available: POST, DELETE and PUT. The POST method allows you to create a List, the DELETE method allows you to delete a List, and the PUT method allows you to update the metadata of a List. There is a user rate limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes for all three endpoints.

Note that you can create up to 1000 Lists per account.

**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved [developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is located within a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects).
