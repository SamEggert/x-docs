This guide will help you make your first requests to upload media using the X API v2 media upload endpoint(s).

For this guide, the chunked `POST /2/media/upload` endpoints are used to upload a video, which requires an adjusted workflow from single image uploads.

For video or chunked uploads, you must:
1. Initialize the upload using the `INIT` command
1. Upload each chunk of bytes using the `APPEND` command
1. Complete the upload using the `FINALIZE` command

<Note>
**Note:** See [this sample code](https://github.com/xdevplatform/large-video-upload-python) for an example written in Python.
</Note>

## Authentication

In order to run the examples provided in this guide you will need to use [OAuth 2](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-2-0/overview) authentication.

You can find your `CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET`, `ACCESS_KEY`, `ACCESS_TOKEN` in the App inside of your Project in the [dashboard of the Developer Portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps).

## Step 1 : POST media/upload (INIT)

The `INIT` command request is used to initiate a file upload session. It returns a `media_id` which should be used to execute all subsequent requests. The next step after a successful return from `INIT` command is the `APPEND` command.

See [Best Practices](/x-api/media/quickstart/best-practices) for constraints and requirements on media files.

**Example Request**

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.x.com/2/media/upload' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
    --form 'command=INIT' \
    --form 'media_type=video/mp4' \
    --form 'total_bytes=1024' \
    --form 'media_category=amplify_video'
```

<Note>
**Note:** When making raw HTTP requests, the request should be either `multipart/form-data` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST formats.
</Note>

**Example Response**

```json
{
    "data":
    {
        "id":"1880028106020515840",
        "media_key":"13_1880028106020515840",
        "expires_after_secs":1295999
    }
}
```

The response provides the media identifiers `id` (string) and `media_key` (string). The entire file must be uploaded before `expires_after_secs` seconds.

## Step 2 : POST media/upload (APPEND)

The `APPEND` command is used to upload a chunk (consecutive byte range) of the media file. For example, a 3 MB file could be split into 3 chunks of size 1 MB, and uploaded using 3 `APPEND` command requests. After the entire file is uploaded, the next step is to call the `FINALIZE` command.

<Info>
There are a number of advantages of uploading a media file in small chunks:

- Improved reliability and success rates under low bandwidth network conditions
- Uploads can be paused and resumed
- File chunks can be retried individually
- Ability to tune chunk sizes to match changing network conditions e.g on cellular clients
</Info>

**Example Request**

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.x.com/2/media/upload' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
    --form 'command=APPEND' \
    --form 'media_id=1880028106020515840' \
    --form 'segment_index=0' \
    --form 'media=@/path/to/your/media/file.mp4'
```

`segment_index` is an ordered index of file chunk. It must be between 0-999 inclusive. The first segment has index 0, second segment has index 1, and so on. Continue uploading the file chunks until all the chunks are uploaded.

<Note>
**Note:** When making raw HTTP requests, the request should be `multipart/form-data` POST format.
</Note>

<Note>
**Note:** HTTP 2XX will be returned with an empty response body on successful upload.
</Note>

## Step 3 : POST media/upload (FINALIZE)

The `FINALIZE` command should be called after the entire media file is uploaded using `APPEND` commands. If and (only if) the response of the `FINALIZE` command contains a `processing_info` field, it may also be necessary to use a `STATUS` command and wait for it to return success before proceeding to Post creation.

**Example Request**

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.x.com/2/media/upload' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
    --form 'command=FINALIZE' \
    --form 'media_id=1880028106020515840'
```

<Note>
**Note:** When making raw HTTP requests, the request should be either `multipart/form-data` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST formats.
</Note>

**Example Response**

```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": "1880028106020515840",
        "media_key": "13_1880028106020515840",
        "size": 1024,
        "expires_after_secs": 86400,
        "processing_info": {
            "state": "pending",
            "check_after_secs": 1
        }
    }
}
```

The response provides a media identifier in the `media_id` (64-bit integer) and `media_id_string` (string) fields. Use the `media_id_string` provided in the API response from JavaScript and other languages that cannot accurately represent a long integer.

The returned `media_id` is only valid for `expires_after_secs` seconds. Any attempt to use mediaId after this time period in other API calls will result in a Bad Request (HTTP 4xx) response.

If the response contains a `processing_info` field, then use the `STATUS` command to poll for the status of the `FINALIZE` operation. The async finalize approach is used for cases where media processing requires more time. In future, all video and animated GIF processing will only be supported using async finalize. This behavior is enabled if an upload session was [initialized](###INIT) with a `media_category` parameter, and when then media type is either video or animated GIF.

If a `processing_info` field is NOT returned in the response, then `media_id` is ready for use in other API endpoints.


## **Step 4 : GET media/upload (STATUS)**

The `STATUS` command is used to periodically poll for updates of media processing operation. After the `STATUS` command response returns `succeeded`, you can move on to the next step which is usually create Post with `media_id`.

## **Example Request**

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.x.com/2/media/upload?command=STATUS&media_id=1880028106020515840' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

## **Example Response**
```json
{
    "data":{
        "id":"1880028106020515840",
        "media_key":"13_1880028106020515840",
        "processing_info":{
            "state":"uploading" // state transition flow is pending -> in_progress -> [failed|succeeded]
        }
    }
}
```

The response body contains `processing_info` field which provides information about current state of media processing operation. It contains a `state` field which has transition flow: `pending` -> `in_progress` -> [`failed` | `succeeded`]. You can not use the `media_id` to create Post or other entities before the state field is set to `succeeded`.

## Step 5 : Post Tweet with Media

Creates a Post using the `POST /2/tweets` endpoint, including the `media_id` on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Example Request**

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.x.com/2/tweets' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
--data '{
    "text": "I made a post with media!",
     "media": {
       "media_ids": [
            "1880028106020515840"
        ]
    }
}'

```

**Example Response**

```bash
{
    "data": {
        "edit_history_tweet_ids": [
            "1880028106020515840"
        ],
        "id": "1880028106020515840",
        "text": "I made a post with media! https://t.co/DqNyXX"
    }
}
```
