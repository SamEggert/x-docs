### Requesting additional App-level permissions

If your application is limited to any of the below app-level permissions and you wish to access additional endpoints, please reach out to your X representative to apply for **Standard Access**.

Developers who requested Ads API access prior to July 2023 may have requested any of the following app-level permissions, which are now included with
the Standard Access level:

- **Analytics** (Read-only): User has access to [Analytics](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/analytics/overview) endpoints with [read-only](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/apps/app-permissions) access. User cannot access Campaign Management, Creative or Custom Audiences endpoints, but will be able to pull metrics by passing through creative entities in the request parameters of the Analytics endpoints. To pull the granularity of media_id or media_name, the user application would need to have Ads API write access.

- **Campaign Management & Creative** (Read & Write): User has access to [Campaign Management](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/campaign-management/overview) and [Creative](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/creatives/overview) endpoints with [read & write](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/apps/app-permissions) access. User also has access to Analytics endpoints.

- **Custom Audiences** (Read & Write): User has access to [Custom Audiences](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/audiences/overview) endpoints
with [read & write](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/apps/app-permissions) access. User also has access to Campaign Management, Creative, and Analytics endpoints.

- **Conversion** (Read & Write): User has access to [Mobile](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/measurement/mobile-conversions/overview) and [Web Conversion](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/measurement/web-conversions/overview) endpoints with [read & write](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/apps/app-permissions) access. User may or may not have access to other Ads API endpoints. 

### Requesting an increase to user OAuth token limits

Developers who requested Ads API access prior to July 2023 may have a limit of 5 user OAuth tokens on their application. If you need to increase your developer App's token limit, please reach out to your X representative.

<Note>**Note:** We do not increase the [rate limits](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/rate-limiting) for any Ads API endpoint. View our [best practices](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/rate-limiting) to learn how to stay within rate limits.</Note>
